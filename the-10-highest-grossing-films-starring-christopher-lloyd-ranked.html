From acting classes and apprenticeships, Lloyd has developed his own path to Broadway, television and some of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Hollywood’s biggest hits</a> over past few decades.</p><p>Check out the highest grossing films Lloyd has appeared in to date.</p><h2 id=a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-43-million>A Million Ways to Die in the West – $43 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The western comedy was directed by Family Guy icon Seth MacFarlane, pulling in a stellar cast of well-known stars. As a farmer begins to fall in love with the new woman in town, her husband, a notorious gun-slinger arrives, forcing him to fight for what he wants. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">MacFarlane</a> stars in the film alongside Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson and a large number of cameo appearances. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">SYFY</a>, when MacFarlane’s character peeks in an old barn, he spots Doc Brown (Lloyd from the Back to the Future trilogy) tinkering with his famous DeLorean.</p><h2 id=dennis-the-menace-51-million>Dennis the Menace – $ 51 Million</h2><p>After some of his most famous films have come and gone, Lloyd returns in the family comedy based on the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">classic cartoon character</a>. Starring Walter Matthau, Lloyd is the villain once again, but comedy ensues as Dennis (Mason Gamble) gives him a run for his money. The precocious little boy is too much for a seedy criminal to handle and Lloyd gives one of his best performances of slap stick comedy to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mr-mom-64-million>Mr. Mom – $64 Million</h2><p>In the 1983 film, Lloyd has a small part as Larry, a co-worker who has lost his job alongside <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Michael Keaton</a>’s character. Keaton switches roles with his wife and she goes out to work, while he becomes the stay-at-home dad of three. The comedy has gained popularity over the years and it wasn’t the last time Lloyd and Keaton joined together on a film.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Shining Lights: A Look At Jack Nicholson's Road To $400 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=star-trek-iii-the-search-for-spock-76-million>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock – $76 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) returns with the crew to save Spock, one of their own against an evil villain, Klingon Commander Kruge played by Lloyd. In 1984, he hasn’t hit his stride and lands a small role in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">famous series</a>, however, working among the veteran actors of the day, the young actor was certainly glad to add Star Trek to his resume.</p><h2 id=back-to-the-future-part-iii-88-million>Back to the Future Part III – $88 Million</h2><p>The third in the Back to the Future trilogy takes fans to an area not seen before, but still includes stars Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. The pair save Doc Brown’s life in the Old West, enabling him to create the time machine and make all right in the world again. The third film didn’t do as well in the box office as the first two, however, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">seeing the end unfold</a> was worth a binge watch of the famous adventure.</p><h2 id=one-flew-over-the-cuckoo-s-nest-112-million>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest – $112 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, the famous film in 1975 was also Lloyd’s first big break. Lloyd plays Taber, one of the patients in a mental institution. He goes along with <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Nicholson’s character </a>when the scared patients work together against a tyrannical nurse (Fletcher). Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the film was later adapted into a Broadway play and then the film, which went on to win five Academy Awards.</p><h2 id=the-addams-family-113-million>The Addams Family – $113 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We love the Addams Family with their dark humor and witty loyalty. In the 1991 version of the film, directed by Barry Sonnefeld, Lloyd lands the role of Uncle Fester, the bald and mysterious family member alongside Anjelica Huston and a young <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Christiana Ricci</a>. While the premise of Fester arriving is suspicious, in the end, he’s one of them and audiences loved the drama and comedy in between. Lloyd returned as Uncle Fester in the 1993 sequel, Addams Family Values.</p><h2 id=back-to-the-future-part-ii-118-million>Back to the Future Part II – $118 Million</h2><p>Lloyd returns as Dr. Emmett “Doc” Brown to send his friend and high school student, Michael J. Fox to the past to prevent a disastrous change to 1985. It’s confusing, but watching <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">all three of the famous trilogy</a> will clear it up for those few who haven’t seen the massive hit. Director Robert Zemeckis returns in the sequel to see Marty McFly and Doc save the past and the future once again.</p><h2 id=who-framed-roger-rabbit-156-million>Who Framed Roger Rabbit – $156 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 1988 film and Lloyd’s role in it may have missed even the keen viewer, but after a troubled detective, played by Bob Hoskins hunts down the evil villain trying to rid the world of our favorite cartoons, it’s Lloyd who <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">appears wearing all black and scary red eyes</a> as Judge Doom. The film paired Lloyd and director Zemeckis together for the third time in as many years and became a cult classic as generations have discovered it.</p><h2 id=back-to-the-future-210-million>Back to the Future – $210 Million</h2><p>In the mid-80’s audiences flocked to the theater to catch the comedy adventure about a high school student (played by a young Michael J. Fox) accidentally sent 30 years into the past. His close friend, and genius behind the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">time-traveling </a>DeLorean was played by Lloyd as Dr. Emmett “Doc” Brown. With his wild white hair and over-the-top antics, fans immediately fell for the eccentric scientist and the film became one of the highest grossing films in 1985.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Net Worth Of The Cast Of Netflix’s 'Wednesday', Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">SYFY</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4yfoKWlo2LAta3Rq6Cnn12YtbO10q2mqaCVp3qtuM6ym2aqkaO4prCO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-films-starring-christopher-lloyd-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-films-starring-christopher-lloyd-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-films-starring-christopher-lloyd-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-films-starring-christopher-lloyd-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-films-starring-christopher-lloyd-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-films-starring-christopher-lloyd-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-10-poorest-cities-in-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-10-poorest-cities-in-the-world.html>The 10 Poorest Cities in the World</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-neisen-wikipedia-age-bio-instagram-facts-on-liev-schreiber-gf.html>Taylor Neisen Wikipedia, Age, Bio, Instagram Facts on Liev Schreiber GF</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-neisen-wikipedia-age-bio-instagram-facts-on-liev-schreiber-gf.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
