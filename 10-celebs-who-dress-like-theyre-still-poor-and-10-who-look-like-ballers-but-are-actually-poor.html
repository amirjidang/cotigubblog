From stars that profusely deny having had plastic surgery to rappers that claim to have millions but really they just rent their diamond chains, it's interesting how the world often sees their favorite celebrities through filtered lenses. There are some situations that people can relate to these celebrity issues, but those in Hollywood seem to take it to another level. For jobs that require a great amount of trust from others, it's not surprising that there needs to be a certain type of persona that one must exhibit in order to remain or obtain success. For someone considering a realtor to sell their multimillion-dollar home, they're unlikely to choose the realtor that drives up in the beat up car and doesn't own a suit. Yet, someone that looks absolutely debonair and has an aura of success in his appearance will probably get the listing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This might be the same for some celebrities since they can be trying to "fake it 'til they make it" in the eyes of the public. For a rapper spitting lyrics about their diamond chains and fast cars, it would stand to reason that it would be in their best interest to invest in these types of props in order to maintain their persona. Yet, things get a bit tricky when their fake persona starts to create some major financial difficulties. It's interesting to see how many celebrities are living under a false pretence in front of the general public. Check out our list of the 10 celebs who dress like they're still poor and 10 who pretend they're ballers but are actually poor and see if you've been fooled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-snooki-polizzi-doesn-t-have-a-sense-of-fashion><strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi Doesn't Have A Sense Of Fashion</strong></h2><p>When Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi was first introduced to the world through her role on The Jersey Shore, it became immediately apparent that she was going to be a standout character from the moment she walked into the house screaming, "Party's here!" Because she became a huge favorite on the show, she reportedly earned $150,000 per episode during the final seasons. Yet, that wasn't the end of her money train since she had a spin-off series for an additional four seasons.</p><p><strong>As of May 2017, Snooki has a net worth of an estimated $4 million and it would seem like she finally had enough to change her mindset about her fashion choices.</strong></p><p>Yet, she hasn't let her bank account change her fashion preferences and still seems to dress like she's in season 1 of The Jersey Shore.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-thinks-looking-homeless-is-stylish><strong>Kanye West Thinks Looking Homeless Is Stylish</strong></h2><p>With Kanye West growing up in the mean streets of Chicago, it shouldn't come as a surprise that he's had a few moments of flashing around his fortune once he made it big as a rapper and record producer. Yet, he's proved that he's not just another rapper looking to sport his gold grills since he has branched out into the world of fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>While other rappers have geared their fashion pursuits toward an urban crowd, West has tried his hand at high couture.</strong></p><p>Many of his fashion shows have been attended by some of the biggest names around the world and he's even garnered the attention of some big wigs in the fashion industry. While he may have struck a huge million dollar deal with Adidas for his Yeezy line, he still seems to dress like someone far from a fashion icon.</p><h2 id=shia-labeouf-is-an-oddball><strong>Shia LaBeouf Is An Oddball&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Shia LaBeouf is an actor that has had a number of hugely memorable roles over the years, with many people remembering him for his character in the Transformers franchise. While he's maintained a net worth of an estimated $25 million, he hasn't exactly been getting the top roles on the big screen. It seems like his personal issues have started to hinder his professional career and the public is starting to see him more as a celebrity spectacle rather than an actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>He's known for a number of antics that have made people wonder about his mental state and his physical appearance has added to those questions.</strong></p><p>While he has been heralded for his amazing red carpet looks in the past, he's changed drastically over the years and now he often looks like a hobo on the side of the street.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper-doesn-t-always-look-his-best><strong>Bradley Cooper Doesn't Always Look His Best&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Bradley Cooper is considered one of the hottest actors in Hollywood and has proven that he has an incredible amount of talent. Cooper has the uncanny ability to completely transform into the characters he plays, whether it's a comedic role in The Hangover or a complicated mental health character in Silver Linings Playbook. Everyone seems to have their own favorite Bradley Cooper film and many of his roles have helped him to be considered a huge heartthrob in Hollywood.</p><p><strong>Yet, his personal sense of style seems to be lacking a bit from the plethora of different photos taken by the paparazzi while he's not on the red carpet.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Cooper can definitely look the part when a stylist pulls a look for an awards show, it's not the same when he's out and about town.</p><h2 id=katie-holmes-focuses-more-on-her-daughter-s-look><strong>Katie Holmes Focuses More On Her Daughter's Look&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Katie Holmes was once seen as a mild-mannered, girl-next-door beauty when she was first introduced to the public through the television series, Dawson's Creek. As she evolved as an actress and grew in front of the cameras, people were delighted to see her transition onto the big screen. When she married Tom Cruise, people loved to see her seemingly find true love.</p><p><strong>During their marriage, the world seemed to see her evolve as a woman and a mother.</strong></p><p>There were a number of times where she definitely looked the part as she stood on the red carpet with her A-list actor husband, Tom Cruise. However, not all of her looks were that pulled together and there were a number of times when the paparazzi caught her looking far less glamorous when she wasn't on the red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keira-knightley-gave-herself-a-strict-budget><strong>Keira Knightley Gave Herself A Strict Budget&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Keira Knightley is thought of as one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood and has starred in a number of memorable films throughout her career. She seems to favor period pieces since she's had a huge amount of success with films like Pride & Prejudice and Anna Karenina. Yet, that doesn't mean that she doesn't choose a few roles with a bit of fun like the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and Love Actually. It shouldn't be surprising that Knightley has accumulated a huge fortune over the years but it is quite surprising how little she actually spends.</p><p><strong>During a 2014 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>, Knightley said that she has put herself on a strict budget and she only allows herself $50,000 to spend a year.</strong></p><p>This seems like a ludicrously small amount for a celebrity and definitely doesn't allow for a great amount of upkeep on her wardrobe. With this photo showcasing a time when the paparazzi caught her walking barefoot down the street, it appears she can't even afford shoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-stewart-doesn-t-care-what-people-think><strong>Kristen Stewart Doesn't Care What People Think</strong></h2><p>Kristen Stewart was once thought of as one of the hottest new "it" girls in Hollywood. She captivated the world with her lead role as Bella Swan in the blockbuster franchise, Twilight, and her romance with Robert Pattinson only seemed to amplify her star appeal.</p><p><strong>During the time when the world was speculating on their romance, Stewart was photographed at various red carpet events looking like a fashion icon of her generation.</strong></p><p>Yet, things definitely changed after the cheating scandal with the director of Snow White and the Huntsman. The strain of the issues regarding her personal life and the scrutiny by the media seemed to take a toll on her and her new daily look is a far cry from the former glory of her heyday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keanu-reeves-gives-away-his-money><strong>Keanu Reeves Gives Away His Money&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Keanu Reeves is considered one of the most successful A-list actors in Hollywood, with a net worth of an estimated $350 million. Yet, he hasn't maintained the same sort of lifestyle as some of his fellow A-listers in Hollywood. He's often been photographed taking the subway, rather than driving around in chauffeured limousines and there's also a great video of him standing up to give someone else his seat. He's given away millions of dollars through his generous spirit and philanthropic work.</p><p><strong>One notable incident was when he handed over his profit-sharing points from the Matrix films to the franchise's special effects and costume design team because he felt that they were truly the ones to bring the storyline alive.</strong></p><p>It should be no surprise that he doesn't opt for the flashy apparel or jewelry but his humble attire seems to only make him even more attractive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears-has-no-control-over-her-money><strong>Britney Spears Has No Control Over Her Money&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Britney Spears has an estimated net worth of $215 million and she has seemed to make some amazing decisions regarding her professional career. From a string of hit albums to her hugely sought-after shows in her Las Vegas residency, it should come as no surprise that she's maintained a huge fortune over the years. Yet, that doesn't mean that she's completely competent at handling her money since she's had some major snafus in her personal life.</p><p><strong>It's reported that she still doesn't have control over her money and it's her father that supposedly handles everything on the business side of her endeavors.</strong></p><p>Yet, that doesn't seem to be because of her overspending on luxury clothing items for herself since her tastes in the world of fashion have never been on point. Instead, she's been hugely criticized for having poor taste in apparel, which often cheapens her overall look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-pattinson-couldn-t-get-over-kristen><strong>Robert Pattinson Couldn't Get Over Kristen</strong></h2><p>When Robert Pattinson first started out in acting, he actually had quite a few different roles. Yet, it was the role of Edward Cullen in the Twilight film series that really made people sit up and take notice. He instantly became known as a Hollywood heartthrob and garnered millions of screaming fans from all different ages. From teens and tweens drooling over his sparkling vampire persona from the films to the moms counting down the days until they could see his face again on the big screen, there was a time when it seemed like the entire world was falling in love with Robert Pattinson.</p><p><strong>Yet, his personal struggles with Kristen Stewart seemed to&nbsp;have done a number on him&nbsp;and his fashion choices.</strong></p><p>He adopted a whole new grunge look for his day-to-day look and it's far different from his three-piece suits that were beloved from his red carpet days.</p><h2 id=bow-wow-hangs-out-with-rich-people><strong>Bow Wow Hangs Out With Rich People</strong></h2><p>Bow Wow was once thought of as an adorable and hugely talented music artist with an immense amount of talent. While he continued his music career for quite some time, he has tried to evolve over the years and is now seen more as an actor rather than a rapper. He's had a few memorable roles on both the small and big screen but it doesn't seem like he's really had that breakout role that has thrust him into the same category as some of the other more popular leading men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Yet, that hasn't stopped him from trying to give the persona that he is one of Hollywood's hottest leading actors and he's been known to take to social media to flaunt his bags of money and private jets.</strong></p><p>This all seems fine and dandy but it definitely turns into a problem once he gets caught in the lie. A great example is when he used a stock photo of a private jet, claiming to be on a trip, but then a fan snapped a picture of him flying coach.</p><h2 id=birdman-bluffed-the-whole-time><strong>Birdman Bluffed The Whole Time&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Brian "Birdman" Williams used to be known as a titan in the music industry and was one of rap music's biggest moguls. The Cash Money label seemed to have the winning recipe for creating stars in rap music and the public all jumped onboard to sing along to some of the various artists releasing hit single after hit single.</p><p><strong>Birdman was often seen flaunting his cash, sporting diamonds galore, and boasting about his cars and homes.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, it seems like there has been a bit of a bluff going on over the years and it's starting to really catch up with him. While he may try and portray himself like he's still a huge moneymaker, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">South Florida Business Journal</a> showed that a foreclosure lawsuit was brought against him due to a loan that went into default.</p><h2 id=50-cent-hid-his-struggles><strong>50 Cent Hid His Struggles</strong></h2><p>When 50 Cent was first introduced to the world as a young rapper that could boast being under the tutelage of Eminem and Dr. Dre, his string of hit singles instantly threw him into the spotlight. People loved his fresh take on rap music and he definitely seemed to play the part of the blinged out rapper.</p><p><strong>He's been known to take to social media to boast about all of the money he has, the fine jewelry he owns, and the piles of cash he has at his dispense. Yet, there have been major rumblings behind the scenes for quite some time, regarding some of his financial struggles.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, 50 Cent wound up filing for bankruptcy. Although he wound up being discharged from the bankruptcy, he was forced to pay $22 million of his debt.</p><h2 id=tori-spelling-isn-t-as-rich-as-she-used-to-be><strong>Tori Spelling Isn't As Rich As She Used To Be</strong></h2><p>As the daughter of Aaron Spelling, Tori Spelling has grown up in the lap of luxury.</p><p><strong>Her mother, Candy, has made statements about how her daughter had the habit of taking money for granted while her father was still alive and even made a mention that Tori thought nothing about dropping $60,000 in just one store during a shopping excursion.</strong></p><p>While people might not agree with this route in raising children, that still doesn't mean that they agree with the way Aaron and Candy handled it in the end. Perhaps in an effort to teach Tori how to handle her finances more wisely, Aaron only left her $800,000 upon his death and she seems to be struggling without the help of her mother's amazing fortune. Yet, she still holds lavish birthday parties for her many children, spends lavishly on her credit cards and lives far above her means through various properties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-depp-has-always-been-weird><strong>Johnny Depp Has Always Been Weird</strong></h2><p>Johnny Depp used to be thought of as one of the world's hottest heartthrobs and there were millions of women that still remember having that foldout poster taped to their bedroom wall.</p><p><strong>He's always had quite a unique look, which has seemed to grow a bit more eccentric over the years.</strong></p><p>Yet, the public has allowed him his eccentricities on the red carpet and at various award shows because of how beloved he was through his onscreen characters. He seemed to constantly gravitate toward the roles that were a bit over-the-top, whether it's the Mad Hatter in Alice In Wonderland or Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean. While he's maintained the persona of having a huge fortune through his amazing career, there's actually been quite a few murmurs about his financial struggles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicolas-cage-spent-his-money-on-ridiculous-things><strong>Nicolas Cage Spent His Money On Ridiculous Things</strong></h2><p>Nicolas Cage is an actor that has a distinct style when it comes to the various roles he's taken over the years. In fact, there are many people that have been highly critical of the way he portrays a role and there have been comments that he tends to overact. Yet, that hasn't stopped him from getting some truly memorable roles throughout his career, from Con Air to National Treasure. It would seem like he has made an incredible fortune over the years, which made it seem like his over-the-top spending wasn't that big of a deal.</p><p><strong>Yet, it wasn't long before Cage was starting to be seen as a cautionary tale. It was reported that he squandered more than $150 million and was dealing with major financial difficulties.</strong></p><p>He wound up declaring bankruptcy in 2009 and then started taking on roles from low-budget films to try and build back his fortune.</p><h2 id=ja-rule-was-forgotten><strong>Ja Rule Was Forgotten&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Ja Rule was once thought of as one of America's favorite rappers since he had a distinct sound that made him instantly recognizable. He collaborated with some of the hottest females in the music industry, from Ashanti to Jennifer Lopez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Yet, the evolution of the rap genre seemed to leave Ja Rule in the dust and he no longer was seen as relevant.</strong></p><p>While he tried to revamp his career through the founding of the Fyre Festival, it seemed like he only went from back to worse. Ja Rule was affiliated with the "luxury" music festival in the Bahamas that reportedly cost $49,000 for all of the ticket holders. Yet, it was anything but luxurious and it wound up garnering a huge number of lawsuits for millions of dollars. He may try and look the part of a baller in the music industry but he can't even pay back his ticket holders.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-had-personal-drama><strong>Lindsay Lohan Had Personal Drama</strong></h2><p>Lindsay Lohan was once seen as one of the most talented up-and-comers in the entertainment industry and people loved seeing her grow up in front of the public eye. There was even some ultra-high hopes for her starting a music career since people thought that there wasn't anything that she couldn't do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Yet, the drama in her personal life seemed to hinder her professional career and it wasn't long before she garnered a harsh reputation.</strong></p><p>She started to become known for being difficult to work with, for often taking off work and for being late to arrive on set. It wasn't long before she seemed to be completely blacklisted by Hollywood but that didn't stop her from partying like she was still at the top of her game. She's still being seen jet-setting around the world and her favorite location seems to be Dubai, one of the richest places on the globe.</p><h2 id=tyga-pretended-to-have-money><strong>Tyga Pretended To Have Money&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Although Tyga may have been known to some that were familiar with up-and-coming rappers, it was his appearance in Keeping Up with the Kardashians that really had people sit up and take notice. This was free publicity that made people want to know more about Tyga and things just got even better for him once he started dating Kylie Jenner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>While he was seen spending thousands of dollars on luxurious gifts for her, lavish parties, and even exotic animals, there were some major financial issues going on behind the scenes.</strong></p><p>He's been sued a number of times and many of them are from property owners that have rented spaces for Tyga, either for personal or professional use. Tyga has a habit of failing to pay rent for homes and for commercial spaces but then he spent $220,000 on the birthday gift he gave to Kylie Jenner.</p><h2 id=pamela-anderson-was-forgotten-kind-of><strong>Pamela Anderson Was Forgotten, Kind Of</strong></h2><p>There was a time when Pamela Anderson was seen as one of the most beautiful women in the world.
