She has got two theories as to why everyone went so wild over it. “Let me just say, though, this is a slow-motion video, and everybody is super sexy in slow motion,” Chastain said.</p><p>She also theorized that because the moment happened around the Covid-19 lockdown. “We have all been locked in our houses for so long.

"But then I was like, 'Okay, how am I going to switch [Oscar] in my mind? Because he's literally not Jonathan at all.' So I had to, I literally changed his name in my phone to Jonathan. I did. Because every time he texted me, I wanted it to say 'Jonathan,' so it could just remind me of the project, you know?"

I don't remember what it was, but we went through the entire book and did that.
