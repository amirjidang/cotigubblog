However, the actor is known for much more than just a popular candy brand.</p><p>There are many <a href=#>exciting aspects of Will Arnett's life</a>, many of which have primarily gone unknown during his time in the spotlight. Between his marriages, parenthood, and acting roles, there is a lot of story to tell. However, at the center of his life is his most important job: being a father to three sons, two with ex Amy Poehler and one with girlfriend Alessandra Brawn.</p><p>All jokes aside, many fans wonder how Will Arnett performs as a partner and father. Friend and co-star Jason Bateman applauds his friend's parenting, telling Arnett in their Smartless documentary that seeing him be so attentive to his children, even when traveling, makes him (Bateman) want to be a little less selfish and up his parenting game a bit more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Details Behind Jason Bateman's Strict Diet (And Why Fans Are Worried)</a></span></p><h2 id=will-arnett-has-been-married-two-times>Will Arnett Has Been Married Two Times</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Truth-About-Will-Arnett-And-Amy-Poehlers-Divorce.jpg><p>Most fans know the highly publicized marriage and divorce between Will Arnett and Amy Poehler. However, because the marriage between the actor and Penelope Ann Miller occurred before the star's fame reached an elevated level, many aren't aware that it occurred.</p><p>Will Arnett's first marriage to actress Penelope Ann Miller lasted only a year between 1994 and 1995.</p><p>Many recognize her from her roles in movies and television shows such as Kindergarten Cop, The Closer, A Minute with Stan Hooper, and Men of a Certain Age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eight years after divorcing his first wife, Will Arnett was famously married to fellow comedian Amy Poehler. The couple went on to have two sons after exchanging vows in 2003. After the birth of Archie and Abel, <a href=#>the two stars decided to divorce</a>. However, they remain close friends and actively co-parent their sons together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Amy Poehler And Will Arnett Managed To Stay Friends After Their Divorce</a></span></p><p>It is comforting to see a former couple like Arnett and Poehler come together and co-parent as friends. Having been married for so many years, having the foresight to put the children first and work in coordination with each other is a sign of a good partnership.</p><p>However, Poehler highlights the struggles she had at the beginning of the divorce in her book <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes Please</a>.</p><h2 id=in-2020-will-and-girlfriend-alessandra-brawn-welcomed-a-baby>In 2020 Will And Girlfriend Alessandra Brawn Welcomed A Baby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/alessandra-brawn-during-new-york-fashion-week-2016.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Arnett started dating Alessandra Brawn in 2019. A divorcee like her partner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brawn was previously married to ex-husband Jon Neidich</a>, with whom she has one child, a son named Nash.</p><p>The couple divorced in 2018 after four years of marriage. While many hadn't heard of Brawn prior to her dating Arnett, she was a prominent figure in fashion, occupying multiple C-level and public relations roles in the industry.</p><p>A year into their relationship, Arnett and Brawn announced they were expecting a child together. Alexander Denison "Denny" Arnett was born in May 2020. Throughout his acting career, <a href=#>Will Arnett has played several complex characters</a>. Yet none of them compare to the role he occupies as a dad of three.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Arnett Assures Jimmy Fallon His Son Isn't Named After A Denny's Diner</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Noting that he was much older when his youngest child was born versus his first two sons, Arnett is quick to state that the parenting process is much different with this round.</p><p>The amount of time it takes to get the older two out the door and on their way to school only to turn around and care for a baby is a different realm entirely, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the star admits in an interview with The Guardian</a>.</p><p>In that same interview, Arnett makes it very clear that he has no plans to expand his family any further and is done after three children.</p><p>Between references from his good friend Jason Bateman and the stories that Will tells on his podcast about his time with his sons, it's apparent that he is a loving and doting father to his three boys.</p><h2 id=does-will-arnett-plan-to-marry-his-girlfriend>Does Will Arnett Plan To Marry His Girlfriend?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/will-arnett-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being a famous celebrity in the limelight, Will Arnett works hard to keep details of his relationships under wraps. Therefore, the actor has yet to divulge whether he has any marriage plans in the making with his girlfriend, Alessandra Brawn.</p><p>In fact, the couple dated for upwards of six months before first being photographed in public together and went over a year before introducing their son to the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Will Arnett And Aaron Paul Were Cast In 'BoJack Horseman'</a></span></p><p>From looking at his past marriages, it appears that Will doesn't jump right into a new relationship or marriage after one ends. Between his first and second marriages, a period of eight years elapsed. Therefore, it makes sense that the actor hasn't yet entered into another union.</p><p>However, the better part of a decade has passed since his divorce from Amy Poehler was finalized, so perhaps marriage is on the horizon for Arnett and Brawn?
