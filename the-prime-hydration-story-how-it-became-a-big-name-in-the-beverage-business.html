Once fierce rivals, the duo joined forces in 2022 to create PRIME Hydration, a brand that aims to fill the void where great taste meets function.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>818 Tequila: How Kendall Jenner Is Growing Her Alcohol Brand</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their involvement in the project generated significant social media hype, driving demand for the product, particularly among school-age children and teenage boys.

The drink boasts a unique formulation designed to provide optimal hydration and replenishment. Comprising 10% coconut water, electrolytes, B vitamins, and BCAAs, PRIME Hydration contains zero added sugar or caffeine and only around 20 calories per bottle. The manufacturers have also ensured that the drink is sweetened with acesulfame potassium and sucralose, making it a healthier alternative to many sugar-laden beverages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>PRIME Hydration has driven impressive sales figures in just over a year since its launch. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevnet</a>, PRIME reported $37.6 million in retail sales for the 52 weeks ending August 7, making it the sixth-largest brand in the sports drink category in MULO and convenience accounts, including private label products. In four weeks ending September 4, PRIME sold an additional $8.3 million, and the company said it made another $9.5 million in sales for September.</p><p>One of the key factors contributing to PRIME Hydration's popularity is its range of bold, thirst-quenching flavors. The original product line features nine sports drink flavors, including blue raspberry, grape, Ice Pop, lemonade, lemon-lime, Meta Moon, orange, strawberry watermelon, and tropical punch, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime</a>.

By leveraging Logan Paul and KSI's massive social media following, the brand has reached a vast audience, generating significant buzz around its products. This has increased sales and brand awareness, as influencers' fans are more likely to purchase and promote the product within their social circles. Additionally, PRIME Hydration has utilized innovative marketing tactics, such as a stock checker app and a Discord tracker, to help consumers locate the elusive drink across the UK.</p><p>PRIME Hydration's ambitious goal is to challenge established beverage giants like Gatorade and Powerade in the lucrative sports drink market. With its unique formulation, enticing flavors, and powerful marketing, the brand has made significant strides toward achieving this objective. In just over a year since its launch, PRIME Hydration has reportedly driven a staggering $250 million in retail sales, a testament to its growing popularity and market penetration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story of PRIME Hydration is one of innovation, collaboration, and determination.
