"So I’d suppress it, and the more I suppressed it, the bigger it became.”</p><p>Gisele also explained in the interview that she considered jumping off a balcony, which led to her surrounding herself with loved ones and trying to have healthier habits. <strong>This tough period of her life helped her realize the Inception actor was not right or her, despite her love for him</strong>. “Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same?

It’s a matter of deciding whether they are in it for the long haul or just going to let it die,” a source told In Touch Weekly. “With all of Leo’s girlfriends, once she became focused on work and had her own priorities, he got distant. Rather than have dramatic breakups, they took time apart.”</p><p>A source told E!
