The future house-flipping experts almost didn’t get together after a bad first date and a $50 bet, but they did and went on to become the down-to-earth HGTV stars people know today.</p><p>“Match made in heaven is not a good way to describe us,” Joanna told People in the past. “But when we put our different personalities together, something happened.”</p><p>That spark led to their fame, family (they have five kids together: Drake, Ella Rose, Duke, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Emmie Kay</a>, and Crew), and their Magnolia empire, which now includes a quarterly magazine, a TV network, multiple retail stores, a real estate company, rental properties, a restaurant, and more.</p><p>The couple got married in 2003, and they often post nice things about each other on social media. They also don’t hide how hard it is to keep their relationship, businesses, and family lives in balance.</p><p>Chip told People in the past, “Jo and I agreed early on that the two of us are the most important variable.” “If we can figure out how to be right as a couple, we have a much better chance of being right for our children.”</p><h2>Is there still romance between Chip and Joanna Gaines?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chip-and-Joanna-Gaines-2-1024x576.webp alt="Is there still romance between Chip and Joanna Gaines?" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They were married for only five months before Chip supported Joanna in realizing her ambition to launch a home goods store. On October 16, 2003, Magnolia Market first opened its doors. Over a decade later, the duo finally found their big break when they were offered their own home improvement series.</p><p>During the five years (2013-2018) when their HGTV show, Fixer Upper, was on the air, it propelled them to fame. The pair announced their comeback to television the following April, this time with the opening of their own network.</p><p>On January 4, 2021, as part of the<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Discovery+</a> streaming service, the DIY Network will debut as the Magnolia Network under its new name. Chip and Joanna Gaines, who previously starred in the original Fixer Upper, have revived the show under the title Fixer Upper: Welcome Home now that they have their own network.</p><p>The happy couple has continued to raise their children on the family farm outside of Waco while also running their burgeoning business empire, which includes a home décor brand with Target, Hearth, and Hand, and a two-block shopping complex in their hometown called Magnolia Market at the Silos.</p><p>They’ve been married for almost 20 years, and they’re as happy as ever. In May of 2022, they commemorated 19 years of wedded bliss.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Do Chip and Joanna have any kids?</h2><p>A year after their nuptials, in May of 2004, Chip and Jo had their first child, a son they named Drake. With the addition of Ella Rose in October 2006, Duke in May 2008, and Emmie Kay in February 2010, Ella Rose’s brother now has three siblings.</p><p>When the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">HGTV</a> couple revealed they were pregnant again in January 2018, they startled their audience. In June of that year, their third son, Crew, was born.</p><h2>The Breakup of Chip and Joanna Gaines!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-doing-now-1577387941491-1024x536.webp alt="The Breakup of Chip and Joanna Gaines!" width=1024 height=536 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chip and Joanna’s split, we’ve included this piece. That being the case, they are still legally wed to one another. This year, on May 31st, 2020, the pair will have been married for 17 years. Even Chip Gaines sent a photo to Instagram. It’s captioned, “Juuuust wedded!</p><p>You have improved every aspect of my life. And now, seventeen years later, I continue to learn from and love the most amazing lady in the world. Joanna Lea Stevens, I now realize that you are the woman I have always imagined.</p><p>This photo and its accompanying caption are undeniable evidence that the pair is still head over heels for one another. They’ve overcome a lot of obstacles as a couple and managed to keep their marriage together despite several near-divorces.</p><p>They’ve battled through tough financial times, been the target of several divorce rumors, and been sued by numerous parties. But through it all, they were a united front.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZopp6pLTIqWSappRit7CtzaeYZquknrmtedOonp6smJq%2FcH2XcG9wZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-chip-and-joanna-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-chip-and-joanna-still-together.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-chip-and-joanna-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-chip-and-joanna-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-chip-and-joanna-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-chip-and-joanna-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2023-08-21-082123-chrisean-rock-1676428-602.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2023-08-21-082123-chrisean-rock-1676428-602.html>Chrisean Rock and Blueface Attend Jason Lee Event</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bonnie-hoellein-net-worth-in-2022-how-does-she-make-money-as-a-youtuber.html>Bonnie Hoellein Net Worth: How Does She Make Money As A YouTuber?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bonnie-hoellein-net-worth-in-2022-how-does-she-make-money-as-a-youtuber.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
