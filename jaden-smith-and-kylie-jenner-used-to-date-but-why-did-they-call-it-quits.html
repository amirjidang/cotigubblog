Of course, this was long before Jenner would become the business mogul that she is today, but nonetheless, the pair dated and were all over each other as they jetted across the globe together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will recall how the ex-couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">traveled to London during one of their vacations</a>, and it seemed like the paparazzi never struggled to find the pair together since they were practically inseparable during the time they were seeing one another.</p><p>Smith and Jenner have known each other since they were children, and though their relationship didn’t work out, they remained friendly and are still close buddies to this day. What’s more, it was Smith who introduced the lip kit entrepreneur to her then-BFF Jordyn Woods, but we all know how that turned out.</p><p>Needless to say, Smith is very close with Jenner, but one question that everyone seems to wonder is why the two decided to call it quits so soon? Their romance was probably one of the shortest in all of the public relationships the mother of one has had over the years, so what exactly happened?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-s-relationship-with-jaden-smith>Kylie Jenner’s Relationship With Jaden Smith</h2><p>According to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenner and Smith dated for several months in 2013</a>. As previously mentioned, they vacationed pretty frequently together and were spotted holding hands on a number of outings.</p><p>Clearly, neither one was trying to hide the fact that they were an item, but Jenner also didn’t feel the need to address her love life to others — especially not on reality TV.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trolls Slam Kylie Jenner For ‘Using’ Daughter To Promote Her New Baby Line</a></span></p><p>Aside from her lip fillers and rumored breast augmentation, her romance with the “Icon” rapper seemed to be one thing she wanted to keep private in her teens, regardless of whether she was photographed with her ex-beau.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Cheat Sheet, Smith may have been Jenner’s first true love before calling it quits and moving on with Tyga — and while that may seem stranger to dump the boy you share strong feelings for, it’s commendable that even though the romance didn’t work out, they are still extremely close.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> post from 2020, some fans were stunned to learn about the fact that Jenner and Smith once dated because even though there’d been tons of photos proving they were romantically involved, it appeared to have fallen under the radar for some.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One Jenner superfan wrote in the comment section of the post, “Yea they dated for a while, this was my favorite Kylie era lol. They were very public, they posted photoshoots of them & their friends every day on tumblr.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Moms Who Were Younger Than 25 When They Had Their First Baby</a></span></p><p>“As well as making silly funny videos on keek. She even wore his merch on a red carpet. It was rumored his music was about her & she was in multiple music videos, now deleted.”</p><p>Not only are Jenner and Smith still friends, they frequently support each other’s business ventures — from the latter’s music career to Jenner’s booming makeup empire.</p><p>In 2019, the pair were seen attending Justin Bieber’s wedding to Hailey Baldwin at the Montage Palmetto Bluff hotel in South Carolina, which also included guests such as Justine Skye, Kendall Jenner, and Scooter Braun, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As previously mentioned, once Smith and Jenner decided to go their separate ways, Jenner started seeing Tyga, whom she shared an on-again, off-again romance with for just over two years.</p><p>She’d also been romantically linked to Cody Simpson, longtime family friend Fai Khadra and singer PartyNextDoor.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Celebrate As Kylie Jenner And Travis Scott Reunite In Water Balloon Fight With Stormi</a></span></p><p>In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>, however, Jenner claimed that PND was never actually her boyfriend, referring to their situation as nothing more but a bit of “fun.”</p><p>"He asked me to be in the ‘Come and See Me’ video, and that was after Tyga. It never really got to that boyfriend-girlfriend stage. It was just fun. I was doing what I wanted to do,” she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After ending things with Tyga in early 2017, Jenner began dating Travis Scott, whom she reportedly met at Coachella in April that very same year.</p><p>Soon after their initial encounter, the TV personality learned she was pregnant with her first child — Stormi Webster — who was born in February 2018.</p><p>As for Jenner’s relationship with Scott, that fizzled out not too long after Stormi was born. Their relationship had been plagued by cheating allegations for months, and by the end of 2019, the two agreed to part ways while actively co-parenting their daughter together.</p><p>So far, they’ve done a pretty good job. But as far as her love life is concerned, Jenner remains single as her only focus remains her career and motherhood.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Fans Come To Kylie Jenner’s Rescue After Fake News About Her Romance With Travis Scott</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmpyVo3q0ucitn2aZnpl6rMXLopxmopWju6a%2BjK6qnpxdqbxusMCtnGaapal6uLTYZpuinF2ptabFjJyYpaRdnsFuvdSiq6xn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjaden-smith-and-kylie-jenner-used-to-date-but-why-did-they-call-it-quits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjaden-smith-and-kylie-jenner-used-to-date-but-why-did-they-call-it-quits.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjaden-smith-and-kylie-jenner-used-to-date-but-why-did-they-call-it-quits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjaden-smith-and-kylie-jenner-used-to-date-but-why-did-they-call-it-quits.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjaden-smith-and-kylie-jenner-used-to-date-but-why-did-they-call-it-quits.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjaden-smith-and-kylie-jenner-used-to-date-but-why-did-they-call-it-quits.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jasson-dominguez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-97232-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jasson-dominguez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-97232-html.html>Jasson Dominguez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./inside-britney-spears-and-sam-asgharis-prenuptial-agreement.html>Inside Britney Spears and Sam Asgharis Prenuptial Agreement</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./inside-britney-spears-and-sam-asgharis-prenuptial-agreement.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
