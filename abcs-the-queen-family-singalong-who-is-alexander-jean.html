Ballas danced for 18 seasons before leaving the show to pursue other things. He has released solo music, been in a band called The Ballas Hough Band and is the son of esteemed dancers Corky and Shirley Ballas.

"A few years ago, a mutual friend of ours hosted an online concert where people could buy tickets that donated to charity, and both BC and I were on the bill. When I arrived, It was so packed that you literally could not move. BC was on stage, and I couldn’t see her—I could only hear her. I remember thinking, 'Wow. She’s got it going on.' She sounded like a mix of Janis Joplin and Stevie Nicks. I was expecting to see someone in their forties slugging whiskey, but I was in complete disbelief when the crowd cleared and I saw a gorgeous blonde." And the rest was history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jean also told her side of the story. "When Mark took the stage, my immediate thought was that he's super talented. He was doing a lot of hip thrusts and started flirting with me, but I was all about the business. I wanted to make sure that we could work together. Five and a half hours later, we were on a date, and we've been together ever since."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Facts Dancing With The Stars Fans Don't Know About Mark Ballas</a></span></p><h2 id=forming-the-duo><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Forming The Duo</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alexander Jean became an official duo in 2015.
