<time>21 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Fans of The Office know that one of the most loved aspects of the series is the relationships that develop between the people working at Dunder Mifflin. Whether it is romantic or platonic, these relationships are key in people coming back to watch the show again and again. Jim and Pam may be the power couple from the series, but the relationship that Pam shares with her boss, Michael Scott, is one that should be looked at a little more closely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once the series officially gets underway, we learn that the pair have known each other for some time. As the series progresses, we see some interesting ripples in their relationship develop, and while some of these things are perfectly fine, there are other moments that make absolutely no sense at all.</p><p>Today, we are going to look at the moments between Pam and Michael that simply do not work.</p><h2 id=pam-forced-him-to-sit-in-the-back-of-the-car><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Pam Forced Him To Sit In The Back Of The Car</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Back-thenewswheel.png><p>Seeing two friends ride in a car together is completely normal, but there are times when Michael is forced to sit in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the backseat</a> of Pam’s car. This most notably happens after the Diwali part that the two attend. Why would a real friend to someone make them sit in the back?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-giving-her-the-longest-engagement-dundy><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Michael Giving Her The Longest Engagement Dundy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dundy-metonymymedia.jpg><p>Most people would assume that friends would be in tune with the things that bother their friends, but this is not the case with Michael and Pam. For several years running, Michael gives Pam the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Longest Engagement Dundie</a>, and this is something that has always rubbed her the wrong way.</p><h2 id=pam-slapped-him-in-front-of-everyone><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Pam Slapped Him In Front Of Everyone</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Slap-gfycat.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was something that may have been deserved, but the way that it went down is what left us confused. Pam gets heated with Michael after he starts dating her mom, and we cannot really blame her. However, she winds up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cracking her boss</a> in the face in front of everyone.</p><h2 id=michael-dates-pam-s-mom><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Michael Dates Pam's Mom</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mom-kucdinteractive.png><p>Let it never be said that this was a good idea. We get that Michael is older and wants to find a partner, but he and Pam are supposed to be friends. Why in the world did he think it was a good idea to date her mom? This was a selfish move.</p><h2 id=pam-sees-michael-naked-and-still-works-for-his-paper-company><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Pam Sees Michael Naked And&nbsp;Still Works For His Paper Company</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/naked-huffpost.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are actually multiple instances of this happening, and we still don’t get it. Pam has walked in on Michael changing in the past, and she saw his junk when he was sulking after starting the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Scott Paper Company</a>. Still, she decides to stick around and work for the guy.</p><h2 id=michael-reveals-her-pregnancy-to-everyone><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Michael Reveals Her Pregnancy To Everyone</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pregnancy-zimbio.jpg><p>Okay, so we are going to give Michael some grace here, because this was not intentional. However, it is something that he should have had a little more control of. Michael is the reason why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pam’s pregnancy</a> leaks around the office, and this is not something a friend would have done.</p><h2 id=michael-s-secret-conversation-with-pam-at-the-airport><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Michael's Secret Conversation With Pam At The Airport</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airport-bustle.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Michael Scott is someone that loves attention and he loves having all eyes on him. So, when he finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaves Dunder Mifflin</a>, he tries to do so secretly. Furthermore, he turns off his microphone when he gives Pam some parting words. Why in the world would he choose to be modest now?</p><h2 id=pam-avoids-hanging-out-with-michael-at-all-costs><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Pam Avoids Hanging Out With Michael At All Costs</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/avoid-cheatsheet.jpg><p>Friends usually like to hang out with one another, but this is just not the case between these two. As much as Michael wants to spend time with Pam, she and Jim do everything in their power to avoid hanging out with him. They eventually got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">roped into dinner</a> at his place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-awkward-embrace-at-pam-s-art-show><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Their Awkward Embrace At Pam's Art Show</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Hug-cinemablend.jpg><p>Michael is one of the few people that actually shows up and supports Pam at her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">art show</a>, and they wind up having a touching embrace when she is overcome with motion. However, this gives way to an awkward moment, but we have to wonder why Pam got so weird about things with her supposed friend.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Office: 15 Things We Didn't Know About Kelly And Ryan's Relationship BTS</a></span></p><h2 id=michael-calls-pam-ugly-when-she-wears-her-glasses><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Michael Calls Pam Ugly When She Wears Her Glasses</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Glasses-tumblr.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael is known for saying things that he probably shouldn’t, and this was especially true when Pam had to wear her glasses to work.
