Many scientists have attempted to theorize what makes the place so dangerous, but one thing is certain--more planes and ships have disappeared there than anywhere else in the world. The Bermuda Triangle, also called the Devil's Triangle takes up the space between Bermuda, Puerto Rico and the tip of Florida, in the Western part of the North Atlantic Ocean. People like to speculate many supernatural causes for the phenomenon such as alien activity or experiments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first time the Bermuda Triangle was mentioned was by writer Vincent Gaddis in an article published in 1964 for Argosy magazine. Although there are plenty of unexplained disappearances in the area, it is also a heavily traveled area, and one of the busiest shipping routes. Cruise ships frequently enter the area as well as private boats traveling between Florida and the islands. Planes heading to the Caribbean or South American destinations from up north fly right through the Bermuda Triangle and in comparison not many flights have experiences anything unexplained.</p><p>Some of the more interesting explanations for the bizarre section of ocean includes the idea of interference from leftover technology from the mythical city of Atlantis. More logical explanations have been considered by scientists and it is thought magnetic anomalies may exist in the Triangle which would affect the compasses. Another common explanation is the formation of methane hydrates (natural gas) on the continental shelves at the bottom of the ocean. Experiments have proven the bubbles created can sink a ship by making the water less buoyant and any debris left over from the wreck would quickly be carried off by the Gulf Stream, making it nearly impossible to find the vessel, but this idea would account for airplanes and there are no reports of this happening in the Bermuda triangle in over 15,000 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-flight-19-1945>&nbsp;<strong>10. Flight 19, 1945</strong></h2><p>Flight 19 was the title given to five TBM Avenger Torpedo Bombers that disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle, December 5, 1945 during a training flight. All 14 men on the flight disappeared without a trace. Later during the search, a Martin Mariner Flying Boat also disappeared over the water and was never found with 13 men on board. Flight 19 is one of the most well-known Bermuda Triangle incidents and is the focus of the science fiction movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind which show the men being taken to mars after an alien abduction. In the movie the pilots are returned to Earth by their peaceful captors.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-ellen-austin-1881><strong>9. Ellen Austin, 1881</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Ellen Austin was a large American ship that frequently traveled between New York and London. On one of these regular trips, the ship came across another sailing vessel moving quickly in the Bermuda Triangle with no one on board. The Ellen Austin transferred some of its crew to the other ship in order to try to scavenge it. The crew attempted to sail it alongside the Ellen Austin to London, but the plans changed when two days later they got separated during a storm and, after a search coming up empty, continued to London. On another trip the Ellen Austin came across the other ship once again and sent crew to salvage it, once again no one was on board and it disappeared days later.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-the-uss-cyclops-1918><strong>8. The USS Cyclops, 1918</strong></h2><p>The USS Cyclops was a massive carrier ship that supplied fuel to the American feet in WWI. The ship set sail with 309 people on board and was full of heavy cargo. The ship was last heard from in Barbados where it stopped to load more cargo before making the final stretch of journey to Baltimore, where it was expected. It never arrived, a huge search initiative started covering the entire route of the Cyclops looking for leftover debris fearing the ship had fallen victim to the German Submarines. No trace of the ship was ever found and it makes for one of the largest losses of life in the Bermuda Triangle. In 1941, two of the Cyclops's sister ships disappeared along the same route.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-c-54-1947><strong>7. C-54, 1947</strong></h2><p>A C-54 aircraft took off from Bermuda on July 3, 1947 and was met with a large thunderstorm. The squall would have been the reason the plane totally disintegrated with no trace, according to the investigation board in Florida, but the real puzzle is why would the aircraft have entered the storm when it could have easily avoided it? On the day of the flight, there were only six people on board including the experienced pilot but the plane could have held 85 passengers. Right from the beginning the plane was heading way off course without the notice of the pilot or the navigator on board. Then it changed course twice which pushed it into the eye of the storm. The ground radio operator heard a garbled SOS which was so quiet he ignored it as a genuine call for help. Later he heard a second SOS and then silence. The plane was never seen again.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-tudor-star-tiger-1948>&nbsp;<strong>6. Tudor Star Tiger, 1948</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On January 30, 1948, the plane left Santa Maria, Azores with 25 passengers on board the British Airliner. The radio operator received coordinates and it was agreed the time of arrival in Bermuda should be 5 a.m. The operator was never able to regain radio contact with the Tudor Star Tiger and twenty minutes before the flight was scheduled to land a state of emergency was declared. Hours after 5, the flight still hadn't arrived or made contact and a fleet of 26 aircraft searched over 5 days and never found a trace of the Star Tiger.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-flight-dc-3-1948><strong>5. Flight DC-3, 1948</strong></h2><p>On December 28, 1948 a Douglas Dakota DC-3 airplane took off from Puerto Rico, heading for Miami, Florida. When it was 50 miles from the airport, the flight sent out its final radio call to indicate its position. There was only twenty minutes to go before landing, but the flight was never seen or heard from again. It had 26 people on board, and became the first Douglas Dakota aircraft to go missing in the Florida Keys. Since then, there have been two more cases all of them around the same location in the string of islands just south of Florida.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-flight-441-1954><strong>4. Flight 441, 1954</strong></h2><p>Flight 441 was a huge US Military owned carrier aircraft which was one of the most successful models of all time. On the day it disappeared, it was flying 42 passengers, all naval officers and their families overseas. It was only 400 miles from the coast inside the Bermuda Triangle when it simply vanished becoming one of the largest mysteries of the infamous spot to date. The investigation included the plane, weather and pilot capabilities but nothing was found that could point to how the plane disappeared. The plane's cargo contained life rafts which would have floated on water if the plane broke apart on landing and would have been easily traceable. The pilot never even sent an SOS call.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-witchcraft-1967><strong>3. Witchcraft, 1967</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Witchcraft was a 23-foot luxury cabin cruiser, owned by Burrack who also had a popular hotel. He invited his father onto his boat to see the beauty of the Christmas lights along the shore of Miami at night. They did not even go a mile offshore. At 9 p.m. the coast guard got a call from Burrack, who said his boat hit something, but it wasn't an emergency they just required towing. He also said he would fire a flare to identify his position. The coast guard arrived to the location less than 20 minutes later but the ship was nowhere to be found and no flare was to be seen. A 1,200 square mile search was issued but nothing was ever found.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-piper-jets-2005-2007><strong>2. Piper Jets, 2005-2007</strong></h2><p>The first Piper-PA airplane disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle on June 20, 2005. It was between Treasure Cay Island of the Bahamas and Fort Pierce in Florida with three people on board. The second similar incident happened on April 10, 2007 near Berry Island. The pilot was alone on board without any passengers.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-trislander-2008><strong>1. Trislander, 2008</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most recent disappearance in the Bermuda Triangle was in 2008, and after the incidents and missing crafts seem to just come to an end. Prior to the final incident, multiple unexplained occurrences happened every year in the area. On December 15, 2008 a British-Norman Islander took off from Santiago for New York with 12 people on board. Only 35 minutes after takeoff the airplane ascended and went off the radar. A massive search operation was launched by the US Coast Guard but the airplane was never seen again. The plan went missing around the West Caicos island.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXaLGtMDEq6CoraNisaq%2FwKmnnpmilruksdJmoKdlpJ2ybq7Eq6SunJFiwbO1wKeepZ1f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-mysterious-disappearances-in-the-bermuda-triangle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-mysterious-disappearances-in-the-bermuda-triangle.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-mysterious-disappearances-in-the-bermuda-triangle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-mysterious-disappearances-in-the-bermuda-triangle.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-mysterious-disappearances-in-the-bermuda-triangle.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-mysterious-disappearances-in-the-bermuda-triangle.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./richest-supermodels-2019.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./richest-supermodels-2019.html>10 Of The Richest Supermodels In 2019</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./most-expensive-celebrity-weddings.html>10 Most Expensive Celebrity Weddings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./most-expensive-celebrity-weddings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
