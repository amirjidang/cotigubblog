The <a href=#>controversial founder of America's Next Top Model</a> may not be afraid to share her wacky personality with her fans — whether that's on Instagram or when she's hosting Dancing with the Stars — but she's extremely careful with sharing details about her dating life and <a href=#>her 5-year-old son, York</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans even forget that she welcomed her son via surrogate with her then-partner, Norwegian photographer Erik Asla. Known for being a <a href=#>female boss with a whopping $90 million net worth</a>, many of Banks' followers thought she wasn't one to need a man in her life.</p><p>But the truth is, she's also just looking for someone to spend the rest of her life with. Nothing wrong with that. So fans were also shocked when they found out that she'd broken up with her baby daddy in 2017. Here's the full timeline of Banks and Asla's 4-year relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Confused About Why Tyra Banks Is Wearing Clothes In The Hot Tub With Megan Thee Stallion</a></span></p><h2 id=how-they-first-met>How They First Met</h2><p>The two first met in 2013. Asla was working for Norway's Next Top Model at that time. He crossed paths with Banks on the set of the show. Sources said that it was almost love at first sight as both of them were instantly taken by each other. From then on, the two were inseparable. However, they still managed to keep their relationship under wraps for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As time went on, the paparazzi started to catch them exhibiting some PDA during lunch dates. But it wasn't until 2015 that they officially came out to the public. Fans were happy for the former Victoria's Secret model who hadn't been in a serious relationship for years. Even more when they heard that she and Asla were planning on starting a family. And that they did, a year after publicizing their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Tyra Banks Is Really Like Behind The Scenes On 'Dancing With The Stars'</a></span></p><p>In January 2016, after a "traumatizing" series of IVF procedures, the couple welcomed a baby boy who was later christened York Banks Asla. "The journey to now has not been an easy process, as I’ve shared before," Banks told People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But there was a beautiful bright light at the end of the tunnel for me and his father, Erik." The model-turned-entrepreneur also expressed her desire to have more children in the future. Fans quickly assumed that she and Asla were bound to get married anytime soon.</p><h2 id=why-they-broke-up>Why They Broke Up</h2><p>In October 2017, news broke out that Banks and Asla had called it quits. Their son was only 20 months old. The photographer was said to have immediately moved out of their former Los Angeles home. But insiders said it was an amicable split. "It came drama-free and they’re co-parenting their young son," a source revealed. "He is slated to shoot the photos for the opening credits of the upcoming America’s Next Top Model."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that time, the two had an ongoing contract with the reality show. Nobody knows what really led to their split. But there were speculations that Asla had cheated on Banks. Both camps never said anything about it. The photographer ended up deleting all photos of his ex on Instagram, though. It raised another set of rumors that Banks probably got too busy to maintain their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian Wows Fans They Claim She Looks Like Tyra Banks In Latest Snap</a></span></p><h2 id=maintaining-a-co-parenting-relationship>Maintaining A Co-Parenting Relationship</h2><p>Banks and Asla have maintained a smooth co-parenting relationship in the last years. However, the photographer — who has three older daughters from a previous relationship — has kept a low profile since his split with the SMiZE Cream founder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also unknown if he's dating anyone new these days. But one of his daughters, Tatjana, is out in the spotlight, making a name for herself as a model. She's signed under Elite Model Management and is said to be earning $20K per photoshoot.</p><p>In August 2018, Banks started dating Canadian businessman, Louis Bélanger-Martin. Until recently, a source said that they are still "very much in love." There were even rumors that they got engaged in August 2020 but that was never confirmed by both parties. However, the two seem to be in it for the long haul, with Bélanger-Martin establishing a close relationship with York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The businessman also has a 13-year-old son with his ex-wife, Valérie Martin Scraire. And they both get along with Tyra and her son. An insider revealed that "Tyra’s child has his own room at Louis [and] Valerie’s house in Magog and Tyra moved some of her stuff—clothes, jewelry—there too."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tyra Banks Channels Britney Spears On ‘DWTS,’ But Fans Hilariously Mistake Her For Wendy Williams</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDYq5hmmpGjuLR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16qbHRZpmamqlisaKww7JknqqZoHqiv8uaZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html>What Have Alyssa Milano's Co-Stars Said About Working With Her?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./warren-lichtenstein-net-worth.html>Warren Lichtenstein Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./warren-lichtenstein-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
