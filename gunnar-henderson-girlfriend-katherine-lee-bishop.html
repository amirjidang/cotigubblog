He was raised in a household with a high passion for baseball, that they built a baseball field in the backyard.</p><p>He is a passionate Auburn Tigers fan, along with his entire family. Unsurprisingly, he committed to playing collegiate baseball at Auburn University. Henderson instantly made his mark in his senior year as the Alabama Player of the Year 2019.</p><p>The multi-talented athlete grew up playing various sports apart from baseball, like football, basketball, and soccer. He was equally capable in basketball as well.</p><p>Gunnar was named the Alabama Independent School Association Basketball Player of the Year for his stellar record of 17 points and 11 rebounds per game.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=henderson-parents-are-baseball-fanatics></span>Henderson Parents are Baseball Fanatics<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Love and enthusiasm for the game run deep in the veins of Henderson’s old folks. The Baltimore Orioles star was inspired to play baseball by his father since childhood.</p><p>Gunnar’s dad Allen Henderson is a massive fan of the Auburn Tigers. His mom Kerry initially supported the Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team.</p><p>In an interview with The Athletic, Gunnar revealed an interesting story about how that changed later. Kerry started supporting the Auburn Tigers after her marriage with Allen.</p><p>Both Allen and Kerry are very supportive of their son and often present in the stadium to cheer for him during the match days.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=gunnars-brothers-also-play-baseball></span>Gunnar’s Brothers Also Play Baseball<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gunnar Henderson&nbsp;has two brothers, <strong>Jackson Henderson,</strong> and <strong>Cade Henderson</strong>. Jackson is the elder one, whereas Cade is the youngest.&nbsp;</p><p>The three siblings are very close to each other as they were raised together and all share the same interest in sports.</p><p>Jackson was also interested in baseball from a very early age and was the first to be trained by their father. He played college baseball at Lurleen B. Wallace Community College in Alabama. He also made it to the Auburn University baseball team later.</p><p>Like his older brothers, Cade plays high school baseball at Morgan Academy. He is a massive fan of the Baltimore Orioles. The young lad even wanted to wear his Orioles pajamas to Gunnar’s draft signing, which their mom declined.</p><p>Gunnar firmly believes Cade also has the potential to succeed, and there’s every possibility that the two brothers might be playing MLB together five years down the lane.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2Blo7uivoyhnKeclafAsLqMoKCrpJantqa6w2aimqyYmr%2BqusRmo56dXZe2tLTOqWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgunnar-henderson-girlfriend-katherine-lee-bishop.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgunnar-henderson-girlfriend-katherine-lee-bishop.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgunnar-henderson-girlfriend-katherine-lee-bishop.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgunnar-henderson-girlfriend-katherine-lee-bishop.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgunnar-henderson-girlfriend-katherine-lee-bishop.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgunnar-henderson-girlfriend-katherine-lee-bishop.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gwen-stefanis-new-workout-buddy-is-blake-shelton-hes-my-trainer-w477664.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gwen-stefanis-new-workout-buddy-is-blake-shelton-hes-my-trainer-w477664.html>Gwen Stefani's New Workout Buddy Is Blake Shelton: 'He's My Trainer'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./galey-alix-5-things-to-know-about-dale-moss-girlfriend.html>Galey Alix: 5 Things to Know About Dale Moss Girlfriend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./galey-alix-5-things-to-know-about-dale-moss-girlfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
