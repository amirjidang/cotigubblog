The entire beatdown was vicious, with all of them getting their licks in during this segment.</p><p>But the craziest moment took place when they pulled down a set of metal guard rails, just leaving them laying on the floor. Allin then got launched into the air to land right down onto them, which was <a href=#>a painful-looking bump</a>.</p><h2 id=an-exploding-cracker-barrel-aew-all-out-2019><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>An Exploding Cracker Barrel (AEW All Out, 2019)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Darby-Allin-Cracker-Barrel-bump.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All Out 2019 was very early on in Darby Allin's mainstream push, and he, Joey Janela, and Jimmy Havoc were given the chance to just be as crazy as they could in a triple threat. This one was sponsored by Cracker Barrel, and Darby ensured they got their money's worth.</p><p>He grabbed a literal barrel with their sponsorship all over it and leaped backward to hit the Coffin Drop onto Janela outside the ring. He was laid on the stairs, only he moved and the barrel exploded as Allin smashed onto the steel.</p><h2 id=a-sore-ankle-lander-aew-double-or-nothing-2020><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A Sore Ankle Lander (AEW Double Or Nothing, 2020)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Darby-Allin-ladder-spot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>During the ladder match</a> at AEW's Double Or Nothing in 2020, Darby Allin opted to take a huge bump, but it was a situation where there was no reward at the end of it.

He ended up scaling the wall of the upper level where the fans were sitting, and he then proceeded to leap backward, landing on his opponents in the ring with a Coffin Drop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a major jump to make and the risk factor of him missing the distance was high, and could have been catastrophic.
