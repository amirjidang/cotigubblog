But if Milano was so nasty on the set of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of her most famous television series</a>, who else can say the same as McGowan?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Milano has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">become&nbsp;really political and is very outspoken on social media</a>. But does her rage on the internet come through while on set and does her co-stars&nbsp;feel the wrath of it?</p><p>All we know is that Milano has hardly starred in many note-worthy projects since Charmed, and maybe the reason she doesn't get cast stems from her treatment of her co-stars. After all, she's had feuds with&nbsp;her other&nbsp;Charmed sisters.</p><h2 id=recap-mcgowan-v-milano>Recap: McGowan v. Milano</h2><p>The Charmed co-stars have been known to not get along for years now, but when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they started a virtual shouting match on Twitter</a> recently, no one saw it coming or expected the things McGowan divulged.</p><p>After Milano tweeted a series of posts about why she thinks the Democratic party is so great, McGowan, who is a Trump supporter, fired back, and all of a sudden they weren't talking about politics anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a couple of tweets centered on women's right to vote, McGowan changed the topic and accused Milano of going along with the #MeToo Movement.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Charmed': Here's How Much 'The Book Of Shadows' Is Actually Worth</a></span></p><p>"1) You stole #metoo (a brilliant communication tool, not a movement) from Tarana. You co-opted my movement, the Cultural Reset, for fame, jealous of me for outing my rapist. You made 250k per week on Charmed. (Con't)," McGowan wrote.</p><p>Now on the topic of Charmed, McGowan really got fired up.</p><p>"2) You threw a fit in front of the crew, yelling, 'They don't pay me enough to do this s--t!' Appalling behavior on the daily. I cried every time we got renewed because you made that set toxic AF. Now, get off my coattails you f--king fraud."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To finalize, McGowan tweeted a clip of her 2018 interview with Nightline in which she stated she didn't like Milano 'cause I think she's a lie." In the same interview, McGowan insinuated that since Milano's husband worked for the CAA,&nbsp;Milano was just jumping on the bandwagon to give them good PR.</p><p>Milano's response was; "Do you think we can get #AlyssaMilanoIsALie to trend number 1 before I fall asleep? Everyone saying sweet things—I see you. Thank you. Everyone saying horrible things—I see you. F--ck off."</p><p>McGowan has since "quit" social media, saying, "I have no more blood to give at the moment. I have to save my own life now."</p><h2 id=milano-reportedly-had-trouble-with-her-other-charmed-sisters>Milano Reportedly Had Trouble With Her Other Charmed Sisters</h2><p>Nothing shocked fans more when they heard that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannen Doherty was leaving Charmed </a>after just three seasons. It was like Beverly Hills, 90210 all over again. She was once again leaving because of a problem with&nbsp;a co-star, this time with Milano.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What 'Charmed' And 'Star Wars' Have In Common</a></span></p><p>At the time, Doherty gave a cryptic answer as to why she was leaving, stating, "There was too much drama on the set and not enough passion for the work. You know, I’m 30 years old and I don’t have time for drama in my life anymore. To me, it’s sort of whatever. I’ll miss Holly a lot and that’s really the only thing I want to clear up."</p><p>Notice she didn't mention Milano? Doherty went on to say that her other Charmed sister, Holly Marie Combs, was her best friend and that they'd never have problems between them. That wasn't the case for her relationship with Milano, however.</p><p>When Doherty left the show, Milano was reported saying that she thought Doherty was very angry and that she hoped she&nbsp;hadn't added to the anger. Doherty again made comments that were directed at Milano.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Much Rose McGowan Has Changed Since Charmed&nbsp;</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I want to work with actors who really, really care and that want to be there every single day. I don't want to work with people who bitch about their job and complain about it and say that they hate it or anything else," she said.</p><p>Later on, in 2013, Milano talked about Doherty's exit on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen&nbsp;and said it was "like highschool" on set.</p><p>This time, Combs replied, along with Doherty, to the comments via Twitter, saying, "Working on Charmed was nothing like high school. I went to high school. It was a very important job to me and always will be."</p><p>"Yeah, agreed, considering it helped me support my family and pay for my dad's medical issues, but everyone has their opinion and views," Doherty wrote.</p><p>Two years later,&nbsp;Milano's&nbsp;high school comment was still being brought up, but Combs finalized the discussion when she said, "We were all friends and at times we weren’t."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Doherty was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, Milano said in an interview with E! News that she didn't want to fight any more about things in the past and that she prayed for Doherty to get better.</p><p>Fast forward to McGowan v. Milano. Neither Combs nor Doherty took sides, and instead, thanked the fans. "I just want to say … thank you Charmed fans. No matter what’s happening just know you are appreciated and loved," Doherty said.</p><p>Whichever side you want to take, you can't deny that there were problems on the set of Charmed. It does seem suspicious though that as soon as Doherty left, after clearly having problems with Milano, McGowan comes in and has the same problems with her.</p><p>As usual in Hollywood though, it's a lot of "she said" drama, and ultimately no one can know exactly what happened or exactly how Milano is with her co-stars. Maybe the power of three will help us understand?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 TV Shows To Watch If You Miss Charmed</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiwsRmmKWxo6iubrnIpZinp6NisLB50q2Yq6tdqK6qsIyamaitpGLEsL7KoqWgZaeewal5x56paA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-have-alyssa-milanos-co-stars-said-about-working-with-her.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-chico-bean-is-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-wiki-506264-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-chico-bean-is-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-wiki-506264-html.html>Who Chico Bean Is: Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html>What Happened To Tyra Banks Relationship With Her Baby Daddy, Erik Asla?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-tyra-banks-relationship-with-her-baby-daddy-erik-asla.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
