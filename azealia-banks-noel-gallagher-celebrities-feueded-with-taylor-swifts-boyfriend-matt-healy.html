Despite everything Swift has accomplished, the truth is it feels like she has gotten almost as much attention for <a href=#>her feuds with people like Scooter Braun</a> and Katy Perry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that it has been a while since reports surfaced that Swift was dating Matty Healy from The 1975, her fans have been learning more about him. As it turns out, just like Swift, Healy has a long history of feuding with his fellow performers.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-ice-spice-doja-cat-and-pink-probably-don-39-t-like-matty-healy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Harry Styles, Ice Spice, Doja Cat, And Pink Probably Don't Like Matty Healy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Doja-Cat.jpg><p>When Matty Healy appeared on The Adam Friedland Show, some of the things he said about the rapper Ice Spice made a lot of people very angry. While talking about Ice Spice in a mocking accent, Healy called her an “Inuit Spice Girl”, a “chubby Chinese lady", and "dumb".</p><p>After being called out by lots of people on social media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Healy half apologized</a>. “I just feel a bit bad, and I’m kind of a bit sorry if I’ve offended you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During that same podcast appearance, Healy spoke about sliding into Doja Cat's DMs and rumors she hung out in chat rooms for white supremacists. After the podcast was released, neither Ice Spice or Doja Cat called Healy out publicly, but it seems extremely likely they resented his comments.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Pink And Christina Aguilera?</a></span></p><p>During the aforementioned podcast appearance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Healy also spoke about another two of his fellow artists</a>. First off, Healy talked about Pink. “Did you see that Pink’s getting canceled for looking like a lesbian for her career and now that’s being regarded as queerbaiting?”</p><p>When the podcast's host asked about Harry Styles, Healy claimed the former One Direction member got away with similar behavior. “He gets a pass, I don’t know... I actually don’t think the gays really like it, it’s young girls that think it’s a new thing that are like, ‘Oh my god.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Healy's podcast comments about Pink and Styles upset many in the LGBTQ+ community, and it is easy to believe the two performers were angry with him too.</p><h2 id=adam-levine-feuded-with-matty-healy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Adam Levine Feuded With Matty Healy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/adam-levine-sticking-his-tongue-out.jpg><p>If you asked most people what makes bands successful, they would say writing and performing good songs. However, in reality, people often underestimate how important the way a band is marketed is.</p><p>Before Maroon 5 first rose to fame, they were still experimenting with what name they wanted to be known by. During that era in their history, the band called themselves Kara's Flowers and released an album titled "the fourth world".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cover image for the band that would become Maroon 5's early album featured images of the members in red, green, yellow, and blue boxes. Years later when The 1975 released their single "Me And You Together", it was marketed with a very similar image with the same color scheme.</p><p>Maroon 5's Adam Levine definitely noticed the similarity and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called Healy's band out</a> on Twitter. "Hey @the1975, you guys big ‘Kara’s Flowers’ fans?" Healy didn't take long to counter with a tweet many people felt roasted Levine. "I don’t know what the f**k that is but I love that song about being in a phone box or whatever it is."</p><p>A couple of years later, a fan who clearly was aware of the bands' history threw a Maroon 5 shirt onstage during one of The 1975's performances. Without missing a beat, Healy then began singing the lyrics to Maroon 5's "Payphone" before seemingly trying to keep the peace by saying, “We love you Adam”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yungblud-feuded-with-matty-healy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>YUNGBLUD Feuded With Matty Healy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yungblud-looking-like-he-is-screaming.jpg><p>After Matty Healy's aforementioned controversial podcast appearance, Yungblud seemingly called The 1975's singer out in a tweet. "Love listening to three privileged white dudes sit around and objectify a young black female artist who’s blowing up. welcome to your 30’s i guess …"</p><p>While lots of people wrote much harsher things about Healy on social media during the backlash to his podcast comment, he seemed to hold a grudge against Yungblud.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Were Matty Healy And Taylor Swift Matched Together For Songwriting 'Material'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Healy expressed his anger by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mocking Yungblud on Instagram</a>. In a black-and-white video where he used a filter to look like he was crying and had the word "EMO" on both of his cheeks, Healy unleashed an expletive-laced rant pretending to be Yungblud.</p><p>At the end of Healy's rant, he mocked the stands that Yungblud takes as an artist. "I don’t stand for stuff, I stand against stuff… I just stand against stuff and it tends to be the most morally obvious stuff… f**k the patriarchy!"</p><h2 id=imagine-dragons-feuded-with-matty-healy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Imagine Dragons Feuded With Matty Healy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imagine-dragons-all-dressed-up.jpg><p>Just like many bands before them, Imagine Dragons has become wildly successful while at the same time being hated by a lot of people. In 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matty Healy started his feud with Imagine Dargon's lead singer Dan Reynolds</a> when he took a shot at one of the band's biggest hits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Songs like ‘Radioactive’ by Imagine Dragons, it might as well be called ‘Pikachu Banana’. It’s nothingness.”</p><p>A couple of years after Healy's comment, Reynolds uploaded a series of posts on Instagram detailing how hard it was to cope with the hatred aimed at his band. In one of those posts, Reynolds named some of the artists who insulted his band.</p><p>“I’ve gotten over the fact that guys in other bands (The 1975, Foster The People, Smashing Pumpkins, Slipknot etc.) feel a need to talk badly about my band for whatever reason. I don’t feel anger towards them actually, just more of a sadness that this industry embraces, even celebrates this mentality.”</p><p>Not long after Reynolds' post was published, Healy was interviewed for the Chicago radio station WKQX. During the resulting conversation, Healy brought up Reynolds' post and while it seemed like The 1975 didn't want to be too harsh, it seemed obvious that he was annoyed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Did you see that guy from Imagine Dragons? He went online quite recently and was kind of like ‘Everybody’s slagging off my band and saying that we’re, like, not good enough’ or whatever, and he was like ‘Billy Corgan said it, and Matty from The 1975 said it’, and I was like… bro, I didn’t say that. And even if I did say that, why do you care?"</p><p>Healy continued, "You’re a millionaire in a huge band. You don’t say, oh, I’m gonna do this, and also can I be void of criticism? It’s like… no. But that’s not my point. My point wasn’t that Imagine Dragons aren’t… I don’t care.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“If you’re that big – the biggest alternative band in America, radio-play wise – and you’re not saying anything in your music, you’re just saying words… “radioactive, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh”… do you know what I mean?" Healy continued, "What’s the point? If you can tell me what the point is, apart from escapism."</p><h2 id=noel-gallagher-feuded-with-matty-healy><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Noel Gallagher Feuded With Matty Healy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/noel-gallagher-looking-disgusted.jpg><p>Over the last several years, there have been very few musical artists who seem to enjoy insulting people more than Noel Gallagher. Blessed with the ability to perfectly insult people in ways that are devastating, simple, and crude, nobody should give Gallagher a reason to go at them.</p><p>Amazingly enough, Matty Healy once decided to insult Noel Gallagher publicly and bring up the Oasis member's feud with his brother. According to what Healy said Noel and Liam Gallagher both needed to "grow up" and reform Oasis. Still not done, Healy explained his reason for why the Gallaghers needed to put their feud aside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Healy, “there’s not one kid, not one person, going to a High Flying Birds gig or a Liam Gallagher gig that would not rather be at an Oasis gig.”</p><p>In response to Healy's comments, Liam Gallagher Tweeted “it’s our time to waste, who made him the boss of time?” While Liam Gallagher's response was amusing, when an interviewer informed Noel Gallagher that Healy was talking about him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his response was simple and epic</a> at the same time.</p><p>“Oh, that f**king slack-jawed f**kwit. What did he say?” Once Noel Gallagher was informed about what Healy said, his response somehow managed to be even more brutal. “He would never be able to imagine it? He needs to go over how s**t his band is and split up.”</p><h2 id=azealia-banks-feuded-with-matty-healy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Azealia Banks Feuded With Matty Healy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/azealia-banks-looking-annoyed.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Azealia Banks learned what Matty Healy said about Ice Spice during a podcast appearance, she was outraged. Opting to express her anger on social media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Banks wrote about Healy was incredibly brutal</a>.</p><p>“Does Matty Healy know that no one actually thinks The 1975 makes good music? And that he’s a lame poser with a trash cliche band name that actually means nothing. He’s clearly so pressed about a Black girl who knows nothing about him or his music is making more moves and money than him."</p><p>Banks continued, Does he know that Black women are more coveted [in] today’s industry because there’s BIG BUSINESS in female rap? He is so obviously weak in the knees, thin-jawed, and d**g addicted that it’s easy to catch his crusty a** lackin’,”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Katy Perry Might Have Tried To Reignite Her "Feud" With Taylor Swift (But Got Shut Down)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Far from through at that point, Banks continued to call Healy out in the same post that quote is from. Banks then went on to post several follow-up Instagram stories, one of which Banks used to really rip into Healy.</p><p>In a post in which Banks sought to council Taylor Swift to ditch Healy, she claimed that The 1975's singer would give an STD. Still not through, Banks wrote that Healy "is a full incel".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYs52RobaiecGapaSrXaO8priMoJilpJGctaa%2BjJycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZJ%2BdpZqxprCMsKCtoF2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8G0ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnMmqutZZiarq3Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fazealia-banks-noel-gallagher-celebrities-feueded-with-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-matt-healy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fazealia-banks-noel-gallagher-celebrities-feueded-with-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-matt-healy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fazealia-banks-noel-gallagher-celebrities-feueded-with-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-matt-healy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fazealia-banks-noel-gallagher-celebrities-feueded-with-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-matt-healy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fazealia-banks-noel-gallagher-celebrities-feueded-with-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-matt-healy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fazealia-banks-noel-gallagher-celebrities-feueded-with-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-matt-healy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bam-adebayo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-113536-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bam-adebayo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-113536-html.html>Bam Adebayo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-american-idol-contestants-quit-before-elimination-kaya-stewart.html>American Idol Contestants Keep Quitting Before Elimination, Here's Why</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-american-idol-contestants-quit-before-elimination-kaya-stewart.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
