Actually, four of them have been divorced and have been divorced for quite a while now. So while they are not all currently married, all but one member of the cast has actually said "I do."

They got married on May 27, 1995, and are still together today with an adult son named Julian Murray Stern. Kudrow's husband was born in France and emigrated to America for work. Lisa told Good Housekeeping that she met her husband when he was dating her roommate. She had a crush on him then but respected her roommate's relationship with him. She thought he was "the perfect man" when they met. He ended up breaking up with her roommate a couple of months later and remained friends with her. Six years later, Kudrow met him again at her roommate's birthday party, and the two of them "just never stopped," she said. In fact, Kudrow is the only cast member from Friends who is still married today.</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-was-married><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>David Schwimmer Was Married</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David Schwimmer is the most recent of the Friends cast members to tie the knot.

Fans then began speculating whether or not the two former co-stars were dating. Aniston shut down the rumors in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. "That was bizarre," she said. "I could not believe that, actually. Like, really? That's my brother."
