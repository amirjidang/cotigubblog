In this movie, Ralph portrayed music student Eugene Martone, a kid who is studying in Juilliard to be a classical guitar player but becomes fascinated with blues. The movie features, among many talented actors and artists, the legendary virtuoso guitarist Steve Vai, who is famous for his work with some of the greatest musicians of all times, such as Ozzy Osbourne and Frank Zappa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-starred-on-broadway-with-robert-de-niro><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Starred&nbsp;On Broadway With Robert De Niro</span></h2><p>The play&nbsp;Cuba and His Teddy Bear was great for many reasons, but its lead were the main one. In 1986, Ralph had the incredible opportunity to star in Broadway alongside the one and only Robert De Niro. He played <a href=#>De Niro's son</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the reviews have been nothing but brilliant</a>.</p><p>"Macchio, best known as the star of the movie, The Karate Kid, gives a touching performance that captures the teen-ager’s love for his father as well as his attempt to break away from his father’s iron rule."</p><h2 id=he-worked-in-the-movie-my-cousin-vinny><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Worked In The Movie 'My Cousin Vinny'</span></h2><p>My Cousin Vinny was a comedy from 1992 about two New Yorkers on a road trip who get wrongfully accused of murder while passing Alabama. They are defended by the cousin of one of them, Vincent, who is a lawyer, but his skills leave much to be desired. Ralph plays one of the New Yorkers, Vincent's cousin&nbsp;Bill Gambini.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>What The Cobra Kai Cast Has Said About The Show (So Far)</a></span></p><p>The success of this movie surpassed everyone's expectations, both financially and critically, and the performances of the actors have been widely praised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-blew-everyone-away-in-a-musical><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Blew Everyone Away In A Musical</span></h2><p>Ralph Macchio was the lead in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, a revival of a successful musical from the '60s, which in turn was based on a book by the same name. Everyone was shocked by his breathtaking abilities, but <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he explained that they were nothing new</a>. In fact, he'd done the same play in highschool.</p><p>"I was known as the 'Dancing Kid,' not that I was all that great.

This was Ralph's case with Entourage. This HBO series that aired from 2004 to 2011 follows the life of an up-and-coming actor who recently moved to LA and his adventures with his friends, and Ralph appears in one episode of 2005, as a very over-the-top version of himself. He gets into a lot of drama in the episode and ends up in an iconic fight in the Playboy mansion. Surely a peak for the already amazing series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-appeared-in-a-music-video><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Appeared In A Music Video</span></h2><p>Ralph Macchio appeared in the 2007 music video for the song Sweep the Leg&nbsp;by Los Angeles duo No More Kings.&nbsp;In the video, he was featured as a&nbsp;caricature of himself and Daniel from <i>The Karate Kid,&nbsp;</i>and his appearance did wonders for&nbsp;No More Kings.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Cobra Kai: Behind The Scenes Details & Secrets</a></span></p><p>Having him on their video gave the musicians a lot more exposure and became one of the most viewed videos at the time.

He did a very good job and made his way to the semifinals, where he was eliminated. Overall, he ended up in the fourth place that season. There were aspects of the show that Ralph wasn't fully comfortable with, but even so, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has good memories of his time there</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have mixed feelings about the competition element of the show and how the machine works, quote-unquote.

In 2012, there was a movie adaptation titled&nbsp;Hitchcock, and it featured movie stars like <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>, <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a>, and the one and only Anthony Hopkins. Of course, with such a prestigious cast, Ralph Macchio was an obvious choice. He got to play the&nbsp;<i>Psycho</i> screenwriter, Joseph Stefano.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-a-guest-star-on-how-i-met-your-mother><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Was A Guest Star On 'How I Met Your Mother'</span></h2><p><a href=#>How I Met Your Mother</a>&nbsp;has become, undoubtedly, one of the most successful sit-coms of its generation. So, of course, getting amazing guests is not a problem. For an episode called The Bro Mitzvah, Ralph made a special appearance in which he portrayed himself. In the episode, Ralph is invited to Barney's bachelor party as a surprise, but it turns out Barney hates him and says he wants to see the "real karate kid," who in his opinion is&nbsp;William Zabka. Furious, he has the nerve to kick him out of the party.</p><h2 id=a-room-of-my-own><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Room Of My Own</span></h2><p>The play&nbsp;A Room of My Own is semiautobiographical, and it was written and directed by Charles Messina. It tells the story of a boy growing up in an eccentric Italian-American family in Greenwich Village, and Ralph Macchio co-stars in it in 2016, alongside <a href=#>Sex and the City</a>&nbsp;star Mario Cantone. It was an Off-Broadway production that Ralph was very excited to be a part of, since&nbsp; he had read the play some time ago and had loved it very much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class="related-single next-single">NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Robert De Niro's Best Movies, Ranked By Money Made</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGenMBuvsClp6FlnZawpLTIqGSdoZRir6bA1p6cp2WknbJuu8ZmopqqkamybrfInWScp5Knrm63wKJm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthings-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthings-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthings-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthings-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthings-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthings-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-signs-your-girl-is-a-real-gold-digger.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-signs-your-girl-is-a-real-gold-digger.html>15 Signs Your Girl Is A Real Gold Digger</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html>10 Female Celebs Who Went Black And Actually Went Back</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
