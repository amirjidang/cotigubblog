Even though their little bubble over Westview, New Jersey, was mostly fake, their love for each other wasn't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neither is their real-life counterpart's relationship.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen</a> (Lizzie, as Bettany calls her) have had great chemistry on and off-screen since they first signed on to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>.&nbsp;They figured out they have the same work ethic and formed this bond of trust in playing these loveable characters.</p><p>At the end of Infinity War and Endgame, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bettany thought he was fired from Marvel</a>, and we thought we'd never get to see what&nbsp;Wanda and Vision's lives would be like together. But WandaVision brought the two friends back together and answered our questions...while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adding even greater questions</a> along the way. Even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wanda's sitcom heaven of a life</a>, which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">really just therapy</a>, was destroyed, there's still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another Vision roaming around out there</a>. So we've yet to see the last of Bettany and Olsen and their characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But while we wait for future Wanda and Vision moments, let's look at all the adorable Bettany and Olsen moments that have happened ever since the two actors found out that they were a prosperous work marriage.</p><h2 id=their-joint-interviews-are-adorable>Their Joint Interviews Are Adorable</h2><p>Months before WandaVision started streaming, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bettany and Olsen interviewed each other</a> for Interview magazine. They asked each other "newlywed questions" to honor their character's newlywed status and test their offscreen chemistry.</p><p>They talked about everything from the election to what they thought about WandaVision and quizzed each other things like what they'd do instead of acting (Olsen was correct in saying Bettany would be a writer just like Bettany was correct, guessing Olsen would be a great designer), and what their superpowers would be (Bettany said flying and Olsen&nbsp;said the power to heal).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Paul Bettany Has Said About Working On 'The Da Vinci Code'</a></span></p><p>They also went into more newlywed topics like who's the neatest ("Definitely you," Bettany said. "Yes, I’m pretty neat, but I wouldn’t consider you messy, either," Olsen replied), who's the best cook ("It’s you. I love to cook, but nobody loves to cook more than you," Bettany said. "Yeah, but I haven’t had your cooking, so I couldn’t answer this question honestly," Olsen interjected), and who's more likely to deal with a spider ("I think both of us would be fine with spiders," Bettany explained. "You are. I hate spiders. That’s on you," Olsen joked).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the other questions were hilarious. Bettany and Olsen both agreed that Bettany's Diet Coke drinking habit was out of control ("I will say that when I walked into a trailer that was filled with Diet Coke, I knew you were in that trailer before me," Olsen said), that they'd both probably have caviar as their last meal, and that two celebrities stuck on a deserted island together would have disastrous effects.</p><p>They talked about eggs too. Olsen said her location and mood dictate how she likes her eggs cooked, but Bettany said he thinks that she likes them over-easy. "I don’t think you’re going to like a rubbery egg, or rubbery scrambled eggs, but I can also see you with a soft poached egg, given the right morning," Bettany said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Jennifer Connelly And 'MCU' Star Paul Bettany's Private Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The interview was hilarious overall, of course, and really gave us insight into how well the two co-stars know each other. They agreed on a lot. This is just one of the thousands of examples of how well they know each other and how much fun they have. BuzzFeed literally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">listed out 23 examples</a> in their article, "23 Elizabeth Olsen And Paul Bettany Behind-The-Scenes Moments That Prove Platonic Soulmates Totally Exist."</p><p>Then there's "snotgate," which was a historic moment in their relationship. They have different stories about how Bettany's snot got on Olsen's face during a kissing scene (Olsen says Bettany stormed off, while Bettany says that it wasn't his snot), but they didn't let their little argument affect their friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-trust-each-other-completely>They Trust Each Other Completely</h2><p>In an interview with E! News, the pair agreed that they love working together because they have similar work ethics. They also know that they can trust each other when it comes to messing up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These 3 Actors Are 'MCU' Star Paul Bettany's Childhood Heroes</a></span></p><p>"We are very similar when it comes to how we work," Olsen said. "Trust is important in those moments, and you know having the guts to maybe fail and feel safe when you know you're working with someone, and so we really enjoyed that experience together. It only [made it] so much more fun. So it was just an amazing opportunity to just make fools of ourselves."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bettany said, "I think Lizzie and my relationship is based entirely on respect and happened really slowly in that you suddenly realize, 'I've been working with this person for years, and she's never been late onset.' I'm never late. And not only is she never late, she's always incredibly well prepared."</p><p>They also like to come to set bouncing ideas off each other and also have improvised scenes. "I think we both slowly sort of realized, 'Oh my god, we've got exactly the same work ethic.' We both work really hard. I can't do it any other way," Bettany continued.</p><p>So long story short, we love Bettany and Olsen's friendship and their working relationship just as much as we love the characters they play. We just hope Marvel gives them the chance to work together again so we can finally see Wanda and Vision ride off into the sunset once and for all.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Was Elizabeth Olsen Before Becoming Wanda Maximoff</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6prjIs5ibnaSderC40p6lZpmemXqxrdSlZJudpKmur8XSZqmemZxiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-elizabeth-olsen-and-paul-bettanys-real-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-truth-about-elizabeth-olsen-and-paul-bettanys-real-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-elizabeth-olsen-and-paul-bettanys-real-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-truth-about-elizabeth-olsen-and-paul-bettanys-real-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-elizabeth-olsen-and-paul-bettanys-real-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-elizabeth-olsen-and-paul-bettanys-real-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-peas-net-worth-and-how-he-spends-it.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-peas-net-worth-and-how-he-spends-it.html>The Truth About Michael Pea's Net Worth And How He Spends It</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aj-michalka-boyfriend-josh-pence-joe-jonas-relationship-history-aly-and-aj-disney-dating.html>The Truth About AJ Michalka's Relationship History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./aj-michalka-boyfriend-josh-pence-joe-jonas-relationship-history-aly-and-aj-disney-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
