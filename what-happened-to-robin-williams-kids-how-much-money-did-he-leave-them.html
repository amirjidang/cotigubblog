As much as fans were saddened that the beloved actor was gone, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams' three children</a></strong> obviously were hit much harder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/who-did-robin-williams-leave-all-his-money-to-and-why-did-it-spark-such-a-bitter-family-feud_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On April 11, 1983, Williams became a father for the first time.

At that time, Zelda Williams was cast as the daughter of a character portrayed by her father in the 1994 TV movie In Search of Dr. Seuss.</p><p>Since Robin Williams' tragic passing, Zelda Williams has continued to pursue her passion for storytelling. Most obviously, Zelda Williams has continued to act as she has landed a series of roles.

First off, Lisa Frankenstein was penned by Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning writer behind the movie Juno. Lisa Frankenstein also stars Kathryn Newton, Cole Sprouse, and Carla Gugino.</p><p>A couple of years after Zelda Williams was born, Robin Williams and Marsha Garces Williams had another child. On November 25, 1991, <strong>Robin and Garces welcomed their son, Cody Alan Williams</strong>, who is 32 years old as of this writing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/robin-williams-with-his-son-cody-williams-and-his-daughter-zelda-williams.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike his two older siblings, next to nothing is known about Cody Williams. Since that is a choice that Cody Williams appears to have made for himself, it makes perfect sense to respect his privacy.</p><p>The main fact about Cody's life that is known to the public is that he married Maria Flores on July 21, 2019. During the couple's wedding ceremony, those in attendance paid tribute to the family members who'd been lost, like Robin Williams.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Robin Williams' two oldest kids regularly pay tribute to their father. A perfect example of that is on what would have been Robin Williams' 72nd birthday, Zak and Zelda Williams both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted about him on social media</a>.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-robin-williams-leave-his-children-in-his-will>How Much Money Did Robin Williams Leave His Children In His Will?</h2><p>Unfortunately for Robin Williams' loved ones, things weren't simple when the actor passed away.

The legal battle was over the contents of that home and Schneider's legal expenses. Ultimately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a settlement was reached</a> which called for Schneider to keep living in the home and receive money for her expenses.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Other stars whose estates inspired legal battles</a> according to ABC News</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Michael Jackson</strong></li><li><strong>Steve McNair</strong></li><li><strong>James Brown</strong></li><li><strong>Anna Nicole Smith</strong></li><li><strong>Jimi Hendrix</strong></li><li><strong>Jerry Garcia</strong></li><li><strong>Martin Luther King, Jr.</strong></li><li><strong>Brooke Astor</strong></li><li><strong>Michael Crichton</strong></li><li><strong>Tom Carvel</strong></li><li><strong>Marlon Brando</strong></li></ul><p>Once that settlement was reached, that put all the drama to rest. As articles by Vanity Fair and other credible outlets reported, aside from providing his widow with somewhere to live, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams left everything to his three children</a>.

While it seems unlikely that his kids will sell Williams' artifacts, the truth is that many of the actors' items also have a lot of value that his kids could cash in on in theory.</p><p>Finally, according to a 2014 Business Insider report which cited documents obtained by TMZ, Williams provided for his kids in another way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams reportedly set up a 3-part trust fund for his kids</a> which was worth an unknown amount. Business Insider also outlined the rules of the trust. Given what was reported, Zelda and Cody received money from the trust following their father's passing.</p><p>"When each turned 21 they got 1/3 of the share. When they turned 25 they got half of what remained. When they turned 30 they each got their full share. The trust was not dependent on Robin's death. The kids received their money, although Cody and Zelda have not been paid in full because of their age."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8br7Om6CnZaeeua21wKaqZqOZmcButM6wZKatk516rrvNnrBmnJmZeqmxjKWcmq6VYsGpscxo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-robin-williams-kids-how-much-money-did-he-leave-them.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-robin-williams-kids-how-much-money-did-he-leave-them.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-robin-williams-kids-how-much-money-did-he-leave-them.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-robin-williams-kids-how-much-money-did-he-leave-them.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-robin-williams-kids-how-much-money-did-he-leave-them.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-robin-williams-kids-how-much-money-did-he-leave-them.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-alexa-dixons-husband-azuka-ononye-what-does-azuka-ononye-do.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-alexa-dixons-husband-azuka-ononye-what-does-azuka-ononye-do.html>Who is Alexa Dixons husband Azuka Ononye?
