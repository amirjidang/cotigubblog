The former couple parted ways the following year, People reports. This was two years before Green started dating Megan Fox, but there is believed to have been trouble with his ex and his new relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brian Austin Green's Chronic Health Issues Have Changed His Life And Career In Frustrating And Devastating Ways</a></span></p><p>"Ever since Brian and Megan started dating, Brian had conflicts with Vanessa," a source told People.

Kass has never met his youngest brother and is not allowed to know where his bio father, stepmother and three younger brothers live. He has only seen his dad in passing or in public places. Custody cases hurt the children only, and the truth shall set us all free. Put the kids first, you guys. There shouldn't be a 'more important parent' kids love both parents equally, no matter what either parent's struggles may be. Kass has been truly heartbroken since being cut out of his other families lives with NO explanationâ€¦"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brian-austin-green-3.jpg><p>These sentiments were echoed by a source who told People, "Everyone knows <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian doesn't have contact with Kassius</a>. That's his choice, but it doesn't make it right. Brian is a great dad to his sons with Megan, so it's absolutely strange that he doesn't see Kassius." The sons the source refers to are the three children Green shares with Fox; Noah Shannon, <a href=#>mysterious son Bodhi Ransom</a>, and Journey River.</p><p>At the time, the source told People, "It's just a sad situation. Brian could easily fix it, and it does seem he cares.

I did, however, feel sorry for him. I still do," she wrote on Instagram (via Us Weekly). "He's a very angry/sad human being who still has too much shame to take full responsibility for his actions as a father. I consciously knew that I could work through childhood traumas through him, and I have. I have great empathy towards him and other people who are still in pain from their childhoods."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Fox And Brian Austin Green's Huge Age Gap Made Some Fans Uncomfortable</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The allegations against Brian Austin Green are one side of the story, but what has the actor said about the situation? In 2023, Green's relationship with his son made headlines again, this time after Marcil responded to a Q&A and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed that they didn't co-parent </a>and that she raised Kassius alone (via Page Six).</p><p>Green was unimpressed with the claims and is reported to have refuted them on an Instagram story. He wrote, "So, I can't tell you all how frustrating it is to read continued lies from a 50+-year-old woman on social media like she is still in high school. She has never in her life been someone to walk the walk. Talk is cheap."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-often-does-megan-fox-see-her-children_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also claimed that <a href=#>his ex-wife, Megan Fox</a>, had been an involved stepparent.

But he has mostly chosen to live his life away from the public eye. But this appears to be changingâ€¦</p><p>It is not often that photos of him are shared online, which is why when they are, people take notice. In 2022, Us Weekly reported that Green had shared a photo of himself and his son on the set of their film, Rufus. You read that correctly; the father and son are collaborating on a movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Megan Fox's Nanny Delay Her Breakup With Brian Austin Green?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we cannot go deeper into their relationship and reveal precisely how close they are, it is unlikely they would be acting alongside each other if there was animosity between them.</p><p>As for the film? At the moment, very little is known about it, and it does not appear to have a release date. Green also shared another photo from their project in October 2022, using the caption to praise his son and his experience working with him. "Working with Kass on a movie titled 'Rufus.' Such a great experience!!" Austin Green wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brian-austin-green-and-son.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Brian Austin Green will be able to see more of his relationship with his son once their film is released.
