<time>28 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The fan-favorite series Game of Thrones has made quite a number of people famous and Gwendoline Christie has been on the roster of actors for the fantasy-drama since 2012. It is one out of many acting credits that she has to her name and as she portrays the fascinating life of the warrior Brienne of Tarth she has gotten quite a lot of people fascinated in her as a person.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gwendoline-christie-biography-age></span><strong>Gwendoline Christie Biography & Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gwendoline Christie’s full name is Gwendoline Tracey Philippa Christie and she was born on the 28th of October 1978 in Worthing, West Sussex. Her life would have turned out rather differently as she trained as a gymnast when she was a child. Unfortunately, she had a spine injury that forced her to abandon the path. However, Gwendoline Christie did not let that setback disadvantage her much and she soon found a new passion and welcoming career in acting.</p><p>With a career in acting as her new goal, she went to the Drama Centre London from where she graduated in 2005. The school was not exactly easy for her as there was discouragement at every turn. She was told by several people that her look which included a large physique was not exactly right for an actor and so she would probably never work. Even the agent that was to represent her told her “good luck with that” when she voiced her desire to actually get screen roles. Her courage was bolstered by one performance – Tilda Swinton in Orlando. She considered Tilda Swinton to not fit exactly into the Hollywood normal and since she was in a film, she took it as a sign that she could also make it too.</p><p>Like most actors before hitting it big, Gwendoline Christie worked some odd jobs. She once worked in a boutique in Brighton for funky interiors called Pussy. While working at that job which she held in 2002, she caught the attention of a photographer because of her height. Christie became the subject of the photographer’s series which he named Bunny. They were mostly nude and Gwendoline Christie has admitted to being shocked that she ever agreed to them, but then, she equally explained that she thought going nude for the camera&nbsp;would help her feel more comfortable with her body.</p><p>She has a pretty good theatrical career record with her roles as the Queen in Shakespeare’s Cymbeline and also her depiction of Mag Wildwood in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Her dreams of appearing in a film, however, began to come true with a 2007 short film titled The Time Surgeon. Christie feature film debut came two years later in the 2009 film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus by Terry Gilliam. Her career has shown a great range of talent from appearing in The Zero Theorem (2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (2015), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) to her portrayal of Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones since 2012.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-her-net-worth></span><strong>What Is Her Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is believed that the Game of Thrones actress is worth $500,000. She may not have been netting so many roles before Game of Thrones but the show has given her increased visibility which has led to wider success and will in no time lead to a larger bank balance. Gwendoline Christie is likely to soon join the millionaire club.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-she-have-a-boyfriend-or-husband></span><strong>Does She Have A Boyfriend or Husband?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gwendoline Christie is in a stable relationship. She has been dating her current boyfriend Giles Deacon since 2013. Deacon is a British high-end fashion designer. The two&nbsp;are a perfect complement to each other as Deacon considers Gwendoline Christie to be his muse and she is herself a particularly stylish person who regularly wears his designs to the red carpet and sits front row at most of his runway shows.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-height-and-weight></span><strong>Her </strong><strong>Height and Weight</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gwendoline Christie stands at a height of 6 feet, 3 and a quarter inches (1.91 m) and weighs 185 pounds (84 kg). Her height may now be a blessing but it used to get her bullied when she was younger. Now, with her role as Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones, it is perfect. To prepare for the role she started working out with a trainer so that she can gain muscle and look more like an expert horse rider who can also fight with swords.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2Bnmrulu8uipZ5lk52%2Fqr%2FTopxmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZqClqK%2BiusNmpZ6sXay8s8DHZmlo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgwendoline-christie-boyfriend-husband-net-worth-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgwendoline-christie-boyfriend-husband-net-worth-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgwendoline-christie-boyfriend-husband-net-worth-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgwendoline-christie-boyfriend-husband-net-worth-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgwendoline-christie-boyfriend-husband-net-worth-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgwendoline-christie-boyfriend-husband-net-worth-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harley-loraine-tiller-mom-10-facts-you-should-know.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harley-loraine-tiller-mom-10-facts-you-should-know.html>Harley Loraine Tiller Mom: 10 Facts You Should Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stardew-valley.html>Guide for Stardew Valley - Farming</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stardew-valley.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
