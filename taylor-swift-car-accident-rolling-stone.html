She has been <a href=#>releasing various albums</a> (including the <a href=#>re-releases of her first six albums</a>), <a href=#>going on record-breaking world tours</a>, and doing interviews to both promote her <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> and talk about her personal life.</p><p>However, sometimes these interviews aren't just sit-down interviews and can involve the interviewer going to a star's house or going out and about to explore what they do and where they go in their day-to-day lives.</p><p>Unfortunately for Taylor, whilst participating in an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, she somehow got into not one, but two car accidents in the same day, with the reporter in the car with her. Thankfully no one was hurt, it clearly left a lasting impression on her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-took-a-hiatus-from-doing-interviews>Taylor Swift Took A Hiatus From Doing Interviews</h2><p>Given that she's quite a well-known pop star, what often comes with the territory of this is that many journalists will want to do an interview with her. Whilst this could become quite overwhelming, it's often essential if a celebrity wants or needs to promote a project they've been working on that's been recently (or is about to be) released.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/taylor-swift-1.jpg><p>However, Taylor took a completely different approach to this when she released <a href=#>her sixth album 'Reputation'</a>, after a three-year <a href=#>break from music</a>. However, in a rather surprising move, Taylor decided to not participate in any interviews regarding her new album, to the point where she didn't do any interviews for about three years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was something she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clarified during an appearance on </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Graham Norton Show</a> back in 2019, where she was performing her hit song 'Me!'. After the performance, she sat down to talk to Graham and explained why she decided to take a break from doing interviews.</p><p>Taylor said that when releasing the album she decided to come up with a rhyme, which was "there will be no explanation, there will just be reputation." This essentially meant that despite the release of a new album, she wouldn't be talking to anyone about it as she just wanted to let the music speak for itself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Was Stuck In The Middle Of A Love Triangle That Sparked Cheating Rumors</a></span></p><h2 id=while-interviewing-with-rolling-stone-taylor-got-into-two-car-accidents>While Interviewing With Rolling Stone, Taylor Got Into Two Car Accidents</h2><p>Perhaps a reason behind Taylor's interview hiatus was due to her getting into a couple of car accidents prior to this while she was driving with a reporter from Rolling Stone in her car. However, these both happened on the same day in 2012, during her interview for the cover of the magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst on The Graham Norton Show, Taylor talked about the incident, saying how her getting the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine was like a dream come true and how she was worried about messing up in some way. Clearly, her worst nightmare came true.</p><p>She said how she wanted to do her best at everything she was doing over the two days the journalist was with her and that after the accidents happened, she was worried about the story making its way into the interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-snl-1.jpg><p>Unfortunately for Taylor, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">story of both car accidents</a> does make its way into the interview, but thankfully no one was hurt (other than being a little shaken up over the whole ordeal), and it's something that can be laughed about now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-accident-was-taylor-39-s-fault-and-the-other-one-was-not>One Accident Was Taylor's Fault (And The Other One Was Not)</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview on The Late Show with David Letterman</a> not long after the magazine interview came out in 2012, Taylor went into detail about both accidents and how they came to fruition.</p><p>The first accident was her fault. She had been driving with the reporter to a restaurant and was going the wrong way, so she tried doing a U-turn but had to reverse backward a little bit in order to be able to turn around. It was while doing this that she hit another car, which happened to belong to her bass player of all people.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Taylor Swift's Alleged Relationship With Travis Kelce Profitable For The NFL?</a></span></p><p>Luckily no one was badly hurt from this and Taylor and the journalist were able to carry on to the restaurant. However, Taylor seemed to have bad luck that day, as she got into another car accident not long after this one. However, this time, the accident wasn't her fault.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second accident happened when they were leaving the restaurant, and Taylor said it was only at this point that they were able to laugh about the first accident. As they were driving, a car came, seemingly out of nowhere, and hit the side of her car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/taylor-swift-2.jpg><p>This was really where Taylor began to panic because the first time the journalist had been relatively calm about the situation, however, the second time he really began to panic and started screaming, exclaiming that he had a newborn baby at home.</p><p>Thankfully, this time they were also okay, and the journalist put that down to Taylor's defensive driving that enabled them to remain safe with the second accident in particular.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Olivia Rodrigo Songs Fans Think Is A Subtle Shot To Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>David also gave her some advice with this, telling her that one thing he's learned is that it's always better to take separate cars, so you don't have to spend more time than necessary with the person, but also because it can avoid situations like this from happening.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lk5a%2Fbq3CnKCdnZ6perO7y6Wgp59dqMGwusRo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-car-accident-rolling-stone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-car-accident-rolling-stone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-car-accident-rolling-stone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-car-accident-rolling-stone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-car-accident-rolling-stone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-car-accident-rolling-stone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-10-dumbest-reasons-kids-got-suspended-from-school.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-10-dumbest-reasons-kids-got-suspended-from-school.html>The 10 Dumbest Reasons Kids Got Suspended From School</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tanya-tucker-net-worth.html>Tanya Tucker Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tanya-tucker-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
