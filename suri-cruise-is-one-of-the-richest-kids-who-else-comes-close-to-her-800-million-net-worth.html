It’s a weird world out there when an 8-year-old makes more money than we do over the course of a year, but we’re not necessarily bitter. Seriously! The pressures of a $5 allowance were a little too much for us as kids, which makes a $50,000 allowance seem absolutely unmanageable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Suri Cruise doesn’t have any problems<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> managing her wealth</a>, though, and neither do any of these kids, by the looks of it. She's surprisingly responsible, and we wouldn’t be surprised if Blue Ivy Carter also grows up respecting the hard work that goes into making money.</p><p>Some of these kids, however, will never know that struggle. Between paparazzi photos and inheritance piles, many of these kids were&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">born into their net worths</a>, including the Kar-Jenner offspring. But, who are the ones that really come close to Suri Cruise in terms of cash? There are more of them than we thought.</p><h2 id=abigail-breslin-squeaks-in-at-12-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Abigail Breslin Squeaks In At $12 Million</span></h2><p>We didn’t remember her, but that doesn’t mean she can’t be on this list. One of the richest young movie stars for a little while, we think Breslin deserves a spot on this list. She stands out because of the fact that she earned this wealth&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">entirely on her own</a>. She earned it “through featuring in the comedy-drama Little Miss Sunshine, which became a major commercial success and earned her millions.” Not to mention the other gigs she did prior to Sunshine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=valentina-paloma-pinault-with-12-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Valentina Paloma Pinault With $12+ Million</span></h2><p>This little lady is looking at a decent chunk of change - more than we could ever hope to make!&nbsp;And her net worth is one that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">might grow over time</a>. According to Ranked, she "is expected to inherit a wealth of about $12 million. However, many believe that she is in line to inherit far more than that".&nbsp;Sources are in disagreement about just how much money she's going to get someday.</p><h2 id=ryan-kaji-has-26-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ryan Kaji Has $26 Million</span></h2><p>We all knew YouTube was popular, but who knew it was this popular? Apparently “eight-year-old Kaji got his start on the channel when he was just 3 years old, by unboxing toys on camera”, according to Forbes.&nbsp;The article goes on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to explain that he</a> “branched out beyond YouTube with a line of more than 100 toys, clothing items and more, a show on Nickelodeon and a deal with Hulu”. This helped him amass even more of his wealth.</p><h2 id=dannielynn-hope-marshall-birkhead-has-more-money-than-names-at-59-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Dannielynn Hope Marshall Birkhead Has More Money Than Names At $59 Million</span></h2><p>Curious as to how people arrived at this number? Keep wondering, because the details surrounding her wealth&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">are a little vague</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, how much money she has is a bit of a secret, but, according to Money Inc., there are “estimates [that] range from $59 million to $100 million”. The wealth mostly comes in the form of the inherited estate of Anna Nicole Smith; which means there might not be much more upward growth...unless Dannielynn starts working on her own wealth.</p><h2 id=north-and-saint-west-have-200-million-between-them><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>North And Saint West Have $200 Million Between Them</span></h2><p>Now, we’re going to be honest...we don’t know exactly what the deal is now that there are more kids in the mix. We have put them this low on the list because it’s just not a reliable enough number. Plus, they’re so young that we just know they’ll have a million successful business ventures before they’ve grown up. We’re betting North becomes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the next Kylie Jenner</a>, considering her love of makeup.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What It's Really Like To Be One Of Kim K And Kanye West's Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=while-rose-dauriac-johansson-has-100-million-to-herself><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>While Rose Dauriac-Johansson Has $100 Million To Herself</span></h2><p>Rose Dauriac-Johansson gets placed a little higher on the list due to her lack of siblings. Or, more specifically, her lack of siblings dipping into her cash pool. We believe that most of this net worth comes through Scar-Jo’s wealth, as she earns like nobody else. This could also mean a rise in her net worth, as mom’s net worth keeps growing. After all, Johansson is still&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">far from retiring yet</a>.</p><h2 id=the-federline-brothers-share-200-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Federline Brothers Share $200 Million</span></h2><p>Remember Kevin Federline, AKA Britney Spears’ ex? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He and Britney had some kids together</a>, and the money just keeps flowing in for them. While this $200 million is combined, we’re sure that they’d split it down the middle. Their wealth doesn’t just come from their parents either, as “the duo has also made money from their appearances in magazines and on television.” Hardworking kids!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Known Facts About Britney's Kids, Jayden And Sean</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=max-and-emme-j-lo-s-twins-have-200m-as-well><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Max And Emme (J-Lo’s Twins) Have $200M As Well</span></h2><p>What happens to this number when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A-Rod and J-Lo finally marry</a> and become AJ-Lod (we’re still working on their couple name)? We’re going to assume that it goes up, which is why we’ve placed them a little higher than the other kids in the $200 million club. Their earning potential is also huge, as they both seem to have talents and skills that are only just beginning to blossom. It’s an exciting time for this family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">J-Lo's Kids Are Growing Up In Luxury, And These 20 Pics Prove It</a></span></p><h2 id=knox-jolie-pitt-and-vivienne-jolie-pitt-are-also-in-that-range><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Knox Jolie-Pitt And Vivienne Jolie-Pitt Are Also In That Range</span></h2><p>$200 million seems to be the sweet spot for a lot of these kids, including the Jolie-Pitt clan. Knox and Vivienne have a decent chunk of change, both saved up and incoming. And, judging from the fact that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">both of their parents are still working</a> and amassing wealth, this number might eventually be higher than it is right now. Not to mention the fact that they’re still fairly young and haven’t started making their own fortunes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=phoebe-adele-gates-will-definitely-be-a-billionaire><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Phoebe Adele Gates Will Definitely Be A Billionaire</span></h2><p>She doesn’t have it yet, but she totally will. Is it a little questionable to include her on this list? Yes and no. While she didn’t earn the wealth herself, it is a guaranteed inheritance. Money, Inc. explains: “despite being their youngest child, it is reported that she will become the biggest beneficiary on their death. She is set to inherit over $1 billion,” which, judging from how hard Bill Gates works, might be in the next decade or two.</p><h2 id=blue-ivy-carter-comes-in-with-a-cool-one-billion><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Blue Ivy Carter Comes In With A Cool One Billion</span></h2><p>We can’t talk about rich kids without mentioning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z and Beyonce’s child</a>, Blue Ivy Carter. She’s another kid who’s just going to watch her wealth grow, and we’re sure that she’ll do some incredible things with her name down the line. This all means one big net worth. Naturally, her inheritance will be huge (though we really don’t want to think of that right now).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-of-course-charlotte-and-george><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Of Course, Charlotte And George</span></h2><p>The ultimate rich kids actually come in the form of royalty. Far surpassing Suri Cruise’s $800 million, Charlotte and George have the kind of wealth that is indescribable. The kids’ wealth potential is broken down as, “Prince George may worth around $3 billion and may one day get the throne… [while] Princess Charlotte of Cambridge [has] over $5 billion net worth.” These are still potential numbers, though, as so much of their wealth comes from their family.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Celeb Kids Who Look Identical To Their Parents</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqqZYrCzwcisnGaho2K8r7GMqJ1mrJiaerO1wqGcrKxdoLalv4ywn6hllaHApnnCqKSeq12YubC%2FxGarqGWYmr9uhI9pZKahnKG2sLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsuri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsuri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsuri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsuri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsuri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsuri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html>This Is How Gal Gadot Really Met Her Husband, Yaron Varsan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sidney-star-net-worth.html>Sidney Star Net Worth How Much Is Sidney Star Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sidney-star-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
