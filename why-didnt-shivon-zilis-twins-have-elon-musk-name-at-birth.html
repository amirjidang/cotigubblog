And as it turns out, the billionaire now has now fathered 10 children (which is <a href=#>a little more than Nick Cannon’s own brood</a>). Aside from <a href=#>welcoming his second child with Grimes in 2021</a>, it was also recently revealed that <a href=#>the billionaire secretly welcomed twins with Shivon Zilis around the same time</a>.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>9 Little-Known Facts About Elon Musk's Relationship With His Kids</a></span>Interestingly, however, no one would have known about Musk’s twins with Zilis if it hadn’t been for the papers their filed to have their last names changed to Musk. Naturally, this only stirred up more questions, with many wondering why Zilis never gave her children Musk’s last name upon their birth in the first place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-shivon-zilis-end-up-having-elon-s-babies>How Did Shivon Zilis End Up Having Elon's Babies?</h2><p>In the machine intelligence landscape, Zilis is, arguably, one of the best and brightest. In 2017, Zilis joined Tesla as a project director. According to her LinkedIn page, she worked on AI projects, mainly working with the company’s autopilot and chip design team. She has also become an advisor to OpenAI, a nonprofit research laboratory for artificial intelligence that Musk co-founded.</p><p>Around the same time she joined Tesla, Zilis was also named the director of operations and special projects at Musk’s other company, Neuralink. In recent months, Neuralink has come under fire after it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged that monkeys had died during its testing procedure</a>, which includes inserting implantable chips into the animals’ brains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It is important to note that these accusations come from people who oppose any use of animals in research,” the company wrote on its website. “Currently, all novel medical devices and treatments must be tested in animals before they can be ethically trialed in humans. Neuralink is not unique in this regard.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elon Musk Created A Private School For His Kids; Now, It's Been Shut Down</a></span></p><p>Beyond work, however, it didn’t appear that Musk and Zilis were ever romantically involved as many were only aware of the billionaire’s relationships with Grimes and actress Amber Heard in recent years. That said, Zilis has always been supportive of Musk and his various business ventures on social media.</p><p>And even after news broke regarding their twins, Zilis has never spoken out or posted anything on social media about having children with Musk (although her Twitter feed clearly shows that she loves children).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the billionaire did acknowledge on Twitter that his brood just gotten larger</a>, explaining, “I'm trying to set a good example! Population collapse is a much bigger problem than people realize and that's just for Earth. Mars has a great need for people, seeing as population is currently zero.”</p><h2 id=why-didn-rsquo-t-shivon-zilis-give-her-twins-elon-musk-rsquo-s-name-at-birth>Why Didn’t Shivon Zilis Give Her Twins Elon Musk’s Name At Birth?</h2><p>The truth is no one would ever really know unless Zilis herself speaks up. However, that will likely not happen as she doesn’t ever discuss her private life. At the same time, Zilis may have also wanted to keep things under the radar as she raised her newborn babies, cleverly avoiding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the media circus that ensued when Musk’s first child with Grimes, X, was born</a>. “We move and move and move because people keep finding where we live,” Grimes once said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-elon-musk-and-shivon-zilis-live-together>Do Elon Musk And Shivon Zilis Live Together?</h2><p>The now-public filing may also indicate that Zilis and Musk have plans to raise their young family together with the papers revealing that both stated the same address in Austin as their primary residence. Zilis was previously living in San Francisco but moved to Austin three months before giving birth.</p><p>Meanwhile, Musk was supposedly residing in a modular home in Boca Chica. At the same time, while he was still with Grimes, Musk also said that he prefers living separately, elaborating, “I just don’t like things to be messy and anime.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Elon Musk's Daughter Vivian?</a></span></p><p>That said, it is also worth noting that Grimes is also living in Austin. The singer moved there when she welcomed her second child with Musk, their daughter Y. But Grimes made it clear that she and Musk are not exactly together anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Musk and Zilis, no one really knows where their relationship stands today with neither of them ever acknowledging romantically in public. Interestingly, however, Zilis once retweeted a video of Musk’s Starship with the caption, “Even Starships need a hug sometimes.”</p><p>When it comes to Elon and Grimes, the last comment the latter gave was, “There’s no real word for it. I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid.”</p><p>She elaborated, “We live in separate houses. We’re best friends. We see each other all the time…. We just have our own thing going on, and I don’t expect other people to understand it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is also unclear if Grimes and Musk plan to have more children together in the future, though they may still be on good terms despite Musk having fathered more children with someone else.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Does Elon Musk Actually Plan To Have More Children?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalutNmqqGhpqS7bsbIpaCsZaSstq%2B%2FjKGYr51dmrmwuoymrKyjXaOurrGMmqtmmpmnwal7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vibe-sxsw-showcase-bud-light-factory-yo-gotti-anderson-paak-rsvp-409729.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vibe-sxsw-showcase-bud-light-factory-yo-gotti-anderson-paak-rsvp-409729.html>Yo Gotti, Anderson .Paak, BJ The Chicago Kid and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html>Why Are So Many Celebs Showing Up In Uber Eats Commercials?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
