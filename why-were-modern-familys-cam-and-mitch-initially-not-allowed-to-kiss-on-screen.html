Although it may have come to an end earlier this year, the lives of some of our favourite characters such as Claire and Phil Dunphy, Gloria and Jay Pritchett, and of course, Cam and Mitch Tucker-Pritchett will keep the show forever alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Modern Family"</a> debuted on ABC way back in 2009, the hit television show became a household favourite and rightfully so! While we get to witness the trials and tribulations these three on-screen families have to go through, there is one issue that fans began to notice very early on. Characters Claire and Phil and Gloria and Jay were introduced to the viewers as the affection types, they would share steamy bedroom scenes, kisses and PDA, however, the audience noticed Cam and Mitch weren't showing nearly as much affection as the others.</p><p>This sparked fans to question why Cameron and Mitchell had yet to even share their first on-screen kiss <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all of season 1.</a> The public began to get antsy, so much that a Facebook group was created to push ABC to write and air an on-screen kiss. While the reason behind their decision to not have the two kiss in season 1 remains a mystery, we've certainly got some theories, let's get into it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Modern Family" Execs Almost Said "No" To Ty Burrell As Phil Dunphy</a></span></p><h2 id=a-kiss-less-first-season>A Kiss-Less First Season</h2><p>"Modern Family" aired back in 2009 and was one of the few shows to showcase a same-sex couple. Cameron and Mitchell, who are played by actors Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson, became a fan favourite, however, it appears as if their love life was a subject left completely out of the script throughout the first season.</p><p>Other cast members, which include Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen, Ed O'Neill and Sofia Vergara, who play the two other main couples on the show, have had not a single problem showcasing their love and affection with one another through kissing, bedroom scenes or public displays of affection, however, the same could not be said for Cam and Mitch.</p><p>Despite being with one another for 5 years at the start of the show, living together and adopting their daughter, Lily Tucker-Pritchett, Cam and Mitch still had not shared an on-screen kiss, and fans were beginning to take notes and were in dire need of answers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life After "Modern Family": Where Is The Cast Now That The Show Is Over?</a></span></p><h2 id=public-criticism>Public Criticism</h2><p>As each and every episode of "Modern Family" season 1 arrived every week, fans of the hit show were becoming more and more eager to see Cam and Mitchell share their first on-screen kiss, however, the first season would have none of that.</p><p>While executives from the show have never outright explained why Cameron and Mitchell did not kiss on camera, it's safe to say that the show was afraid the public was not ready for it. Considering this was 11 years ago and same-sex marriage was not even legal in the United States at the time, showing Cam and Mitch kiss may have hindered the show's ratings, which was a risk that they weren't willing to take.</p><p>Despite the show writing and casting a gay couple, it still didn't sit right with viewers that executives would rather play it safe than risk offending people with a gay kiss. Petitions starting to circulate online and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook group demanded that writers include an on-screen kiss</a> between Cam and Mitch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Facebook group wasn't the only thing trying to push for a kiss, fellow Hollywood celebs including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Murphy, claimed the writing was "ridiculous" </a>and that the show should be treating Cam and Mitch the same way they do with the two other straight couples on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Modern Family": 15 Controversies Fans May Not Know About</a></span></p><h2 id=the-kiss-finally-happens>The Kiss Finally Happens</h2><p>After pushing for an on-screen kiss, fans of the show and particularly fans of Cameron and Mitchell would finally get their kiss. Writers of the show decided to introduce Cam and Mitch's first kiss during episode 2 of the second season. The episode navigates through Mitchell's issues with affection, which stems from not receiving love from his dad, Jay Pritchett.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After discovering why Mithcell doesn't like to show affection or kiss his hubby Cameron in front of his family, the family hosts a party where things take a turn for the better. Jay is forced to confront his own issues with affection, leading to an apology and a warm embrace to Mitchell. Mitchell sits back down beside Cameron and just as the camera pans to Jay giving a hug to his daughter, Claire Dunphy,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitch and Cam are spotted sharing their first on-screen kiss.&nbsp;</a></p><p>While the kiss didn't happen front and center, fans were able to witness something that hadn't happened at all up until then. As time progressed, both Cam and Mitch shared many more moments like so, including their wedding kiss during the finale of season 5.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of "Modern Family": Then & Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrLKzsYympp2doqN6p63MoqOyq12Yrq55wKebZqWZqbCpecinoK2hkaG5unnNqKtmmZyhvLixw2arqGWbnsC0ec6nZKybopqyr3s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-were-modern-familys-cam-and-mitch-initially-not-allowed-to-kiss-on-screen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-were-modern-familys-cam-and-mitch-initially-not-allowed-to-kiss-on-screen.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-were-modern-familys-cam-and-mitch-initially-not-allowed-to-kiss-on-screen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-were-modern-familys-cam-and-mitch-initially-not-allowed-to-kiss-on-screen.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-were-modern-familys-cam-and-mitch-initially-not-allowed-to-kiss-on-screen.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-were-modern-familys-cam-and-mitch-initially-not-allowed-to-kiss-on-screen.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mileys-new-years-eve-party-with-dolly-parton-how-to-watch.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mileys-new-years-eve-party-with-dolly-parton-how-to-watch.html>'Miley's New Year's Eve Party' With Dolly Parton: How to Watch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alexandra-daddario-zac-efrons-mysterious-relationship-never-confirmed-endless-public-flirting.html>Why Alexandra Daddario And Zac Efron's Mysterious Relationship Was Never Confirmed Despite Endless P</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alexandra-daddario-zac-efrons-mysterious-relationship-never-confirmed-endless-public-flirting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
