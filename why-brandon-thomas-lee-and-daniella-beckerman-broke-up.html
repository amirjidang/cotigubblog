The son of famous actress Pamela Anderson and rock star Tommy Lee, Brandon's life has been a roller coaster, to say the least. He's struggled with a tough family life, fame at a young age, and substance usage. Brandon's handled it all pretty well. He's recovered from most of his problems and seems to have learned a lot over the years. It's hard to say what most people would do in his position.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Pamela Anderson And Tommy Lee's Son Brandon Thomas Lee?</a></span></p><p>Over time, Brandon's family has faded from the limelight. Pamela, herself has disappeared from the spotlight and is currently <a href=#>living in a small Canadian town</a>. Tommy Lee is now 60 years old but is still making music somehow. But what has Brandon been up to?</p><p>Like a lot of people in their mid-20s, he's been looking for love. He's dated a few women over the years. His most famous ex was Daniella Beckerman, a world-famous model with over 400 thousand followers on Instagram. Everything seemed good between them, but what exactly has happened?</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-brandon-thomas-lee-and-daniella-beckerman-39-s-relationship>Everything To Know About Brandon Thomas Lee And Daniella Beckerman's Relationship</h2><p>The couple became so famous due to their shared appearance on 'The Hills: New Beginnings'. They both appeared on public events together and were photographed on dates with each other. Numerous times the couple was pictured kissing or sharing some form of PDA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was never really revealed how Brandon met Daniella, as their relationship was short-lived. By the time fans really got to know Daniella, Brandon and Daniella broke up. According to Brandon in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, they broke up before their relationship was first broadcast on television. Talk about a big yikes.</p><p>There don't seem to be too many bad feelings between the two since they've broken up. The only thing Brandon's said since then is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was "kind of weird"</a> to see Daniella on 'The Hills'. There haven't been any scorned social media posts or revealing statements. So, why did they break up if everything was fine?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-brandon-thomas-lee-and-daniella-beckerman-broke-up>Why Brandon Thomas Lee And Daniella Beckerman Broke Up</h2><p>From the get-go, it just didn't seem like this relationship wasn't going to work out. Brandon and Daniella may have taken chances on each other, but those chances didn't work out in the end.</p><p>The first sign things weren't well for the couple was when Daniella confronted Brandon on an episode of 'The Hills: New Beginnings'. Daniella claimed that Brandon struggled with opening up, and perhaps that's what caused the downfall of their relationship.</p><p>There are plenty of potential reasons for that. Of course, no one can ever do a perfect analysis of Brandon or his relationship or Daniella, but considering Brandon's past, it's not hard to see Daniella's point. Brandon clearly struggled with being famous at a young age and having not one but two superstar parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Brandon Thomas Lee Close With His Mother Pamela Anderson?</a></span></p><p>Brandon's struggled with <a href=#>issues with his father Tommy Lee</a>, and it's clearly affected his mental health. The two had a physical altercation back in 2018. Brandon said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wasn't sure</a> if he was gonna speak to his father after that event, but the two have recovered their relationship since then.</p><p>Brandon's relationship with his mother is a lot better, but it's not hard to see where problems could exist there. On an episode of 'The Hills', Pamela was curious as to why Brandon hadn't married Daniella yet. If their relationship had existed for a few years, that would be one thing, but they had literally just started dating.</p><p>Brandon hilariously clapped back at his mother, using her four failed marriages as a reason not to get married immediately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-brandon-thomas-lee-has-rebounded-since-his-breakup-with-daniella-beckerman>How Brandon Thomas Lee Has Rebounded Since His Breakup With Daniella Beckerman</h2><p>Brandon is currently seeing an Australian woman named <a href=#>Lily Easton</a>. While not much has been revealed yet, their relationship does seem to have a strong foundation. It was rumored to have started in October 2021, and is going strong nearly a year later. Lily's even been welcomed by Brandon's famous parents.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Brandon Thomas Lee's Girlfriend, Lily Easton, Actually Get Along With His Famous Parents?</a></span></p><p>What has Daniella been up to, though? She's continued to gain fame on Instagram as a model, and her career doesn't seem to be slowing down soon. As of December 2022, she isn't known to be publicly dating anyone. It really does appear that Brandon and Daniella have gone their separate ways. It really shouldn't be that surprising though. Daniella is an aspiring model who was raised pretty well and normal, while Brandon clearly has been through the wringer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/brandon-thomas-lee-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>Thankfully though, Brandon has not only recovered from his relationship with Daniella, but he's also recuperated from his faltered relationships with his parents.
