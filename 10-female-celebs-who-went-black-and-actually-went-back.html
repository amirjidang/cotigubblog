Like someone who marries the same person twice, it kind of seems like these ladies were just testing to see if they were still capable of going without their ex-spouse/partner. Had every other ethnicity been ruined to them, sexually speaking? They needed to know.</p><p>Of course, this list is all fun and games. Although black men, thanks almost exclusively to D’Angelo and Boys II Men, have a reputation for being irresistibly sensual, once the lights are off, it’s anyone’s game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without further delay, let’s dive right in, and find out which ten celebrities bought a cone of vanilla after gobbling down a few samples of chocolate.</p><h2 id=10-madonna><strong>10. Madonna</strong></h2><p>The most recent relationship we can remember <a href=#>Madonna</a> having is her eight-year marriage to <a href=#>Guy Ritchie</a> (or maybe a quick freedom fling with baseball hunk <a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a>). But briefly in 1994, the pop megasensation pursued NBA player (and provocateur in his own way) <a href=#>Dennis Rodman</a>. Allegedly, when they first met, Madonna enclosed both of them in her hotel room and pounced on his sinewy body. What happened after that is unknown, but what’s obvious is that Madonna is such an ambitious go-getter than she was the alpha in a room with a 6’7” NBA player. After her tumultuous, albeit brief, affair with the black man, she went on to marry a pasty Brit.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-heidi-klum><strong>9. Heidi Klum</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For years, <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> was married to black and British crooner <a href=#>Seal</a>. She even has four beautiful mixed race children to prove that she went black repeatedly. But in 2012, the couple broke up, allegedly because Heidi “slept with the help” (the bodyguard). Some sources say it was because Seal had an intolerably volcanic temper. But either way, they were together for a long time and did a highly productive horizontal lambada. And yet, post-split, Heidi Klum opted for a white guy. Now she’s dating Vito Schnabel, a famed New York art dealer thirteen years younger than she. You can take the black guy out of a woman, but the cougar hooks his claws in forever.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-chelsea-handler><strong>8. Chelsea Handler</strong></h2><p>We all remember <a href=#>Chelsea Handler</a>’s highly public relationship with recently bankrupt rapper <a href=#>50 Cent</a> (real name Curtis Jackson.) They met in 2009 on the set of her show Chelsea Lately and quickly began dating. <a href=#>Oprah</a> even asked her on Oprah’s Next Chapter if she had “a thing for black men” and Chelsea said she didn’t have a thing for them, but that she was open to it. After she and Fiddy broke up, Chelsea started dating another guy who wasn’t of the same ethnicity, Andre Balazs, who sounds like he might be tawny but who’s actually pretty pale. Unlike the tallest Kardashian, Handler went back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-kim-kardashian><strong>7. Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>In the intro, we discussed people who go black, go back, and then go black again.<a href=#> Kim Kardashian</a>, contour queen of Instagram, is one of those people. Kim dated several black men before eventually marrying a white one. First, there was Damon Thomas, who Kim dated from 2000 to 2004. Then, there was her two year relationship with Ray J, which produced her infamous sex tape. After that, there was a three year relationship with Reggie Bush, the New Orleans Saints running back. From December until May 2010, she dated white basketball player Kris Humphries. They then married, remained together for 73 days, and then divorced. After that, she started dating her now-husband <a href=#>Kanye West</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-mariah-carey><strong>6. Mariah Carey</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> and <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a> got married in 2008. Their marriage produced two children, twins, Moroccan and Monroe. Although they’re still technically married, Mariah and Cannon have now split up (although, before those papers are signed, anything is possible.) But the possibility seems unlikely: Mariah Carey just moved into her new beau, Australian billionaire <a href=#>James Packer</a>’s Beverly Hills home. They two have only been dating for five months, but it seems like they’re completely infatuated. Unlike Klum, who traded in Seal for a younger man, Carey traded in a younger man (by ten years) for a man three years her senior.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-eva-longoria><strong>5. Eva Longoria</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Eva Longoria</a> and <a href=#>Tony Parker</a> were married between 2007 and 2011. She met the Belgian basketball player after a San Antonio spurs game (the team he played for), when she demanded a meet and greet with the players in the locker room (saucy!) They dated for a few years before finally wedding in 2007. They broke up because Tony was cheating, which Eva found out when she discovered dozens of texts to the ex-wife of one of his teammates on his cellphone. After a depressing divorce during which she consumed hardly anything but coffee, she’s now dating Mexican businessman Jose Antonio Baston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-katy-perry><strong>4.&nbsp;Katy Perry</strong></h2><p>Bet you never knew that <a href=#>Katy Perry </a>dated Travie McCoy of The Gym Class Heroes. That’s right: they were together for two years, from 2006 to 2008. She even played his love interest in the music video for “Cupid’s Chokehold”, when The Gym Class Heroes were a more famous musical act than Katy Perry (“I Kissed A Girl”, her career’s lead single, dropped in 2008). Interesting that they broke up in 2008, potentially because her boyfriend did mind that she couldn’t resist the taste of cherry chapstick. After McCoy, Katy Perry went on to have some high profile relationships with white boys, including being&nbsp;married to <a href=#>Russell Brand</a> and a brief love affair with <a href=#>John Mayer</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-ariana-grande><strong>3.&nbsp;Ariana Grande</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though she denied being with <a href=#>Big Sean</a> for a long time, his recurring presence on her album My Everything, most famously as the whispering voice on “Problem”, made people believe that maybe <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> and the rapper were an item. Just eight months after confirming that the rumors were true, they broke up. One less problem, indeed. Now, she has a new “Problem” (literally, “Focus” is such a rip off, even though it’s catchy), but she’s not dating the whispering voice on this one. No, the pint-sized diva is now in a relationship with her backup dancer Ricky Alvarez, who is indeed Latino, but not, for the purpose of this list, black.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-selena-gomez><strong>2.&nbsp;Selena Gomez</strong></h2><p>It’s pretty common pop culture knowledge that <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> dated for a while, inspiring her song “The Heart Wants What It Wants”. It’s come back to popular attention this season, with the release of both of their new albums, what with tracks like “Same Old Love” (Gomez) and “Sorry” (Bieber). What isn’t so common knowledge is that after her relationship with Biber, Selena Gomez dated Tanz Watson, a handsome black model. Their relationship didn’t last very long, not even making it to a year, but date they did. Afterwards, Gomez dated acclaimed DJ (and milky whiteboy) Zedd at the beginning of this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-jennifer-lopez><strong>1.&nbsp;Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p>Before her extremely publicized relationship with <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>, who showed up in her “Jenny from the Block” video to pat her on her famous butt, <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> dated some of Hollywood’s most illustrious brothas. Way back in 1995, when Jennifer Lopez was still just an actress, she dated <a href=#>Wesley Snipes</a>. Afterwards by a few years, she could be spotted carousing around the Hills with <a href=#>Sean Combs</a> (aka Diddy, P. Diddy, Puff Daddy), on whose arm she was when she went to the Grammys in that infamous green Versace dress. She then married slightly dark Cris Judd, before meeting Ben Affleck who low-key wrecked their home with leading man looks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2bsq6ty55knJ2cmq%2B0edahpmavlaPBbq7LmpqkZZGjsW6twq2smqScrnq4sc2tZJuZk6B8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-went-black-and-actually-went-back.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./things-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./things-ralph-macchio-did-between-the-og-karate-kid-cobra-kai.html>10 Things Ralph Macchio Did Between The OG 'Karate Kid' &amp;amp; 'Cobra Kai'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1188-a-pair-the-most-expensive-socks-in-the-world.html>$1,188 A Pair: The Most Expensive Socks In The World</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1188-a-pair-the-most-expensive-socks-in-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
