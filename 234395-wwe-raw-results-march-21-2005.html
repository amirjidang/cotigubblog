He says it never ceases to amaze him how underappreciated he is. He asks these people if they knew what he went through, especially with making Randy Orton and Batista into stars out of nothing. He then goes on to talk about Evolution’s glory days. He says some said they were unstoppable, but that was not true. He says the only thing that could stop Evolution, was Evolution. He then talks about Batista and his selfishness and how he wants to make a name for himself now. He says Batista made a BAD decision to turn on HHH after winning the Royal Rumble. HHH says he guarantees Batista would have beaten JBL and John Cena, hell, even both of them at the same time, but instead he chose to stay here. “And you… will… lose..” He says Dave, you are NOT good enough. He says he doesn’t even know why Batista would even consider himself at HHH’s level. HHH says he has beaten them ALL! HHH says Batista wasn’t even at WrestleMania long enough to get a cup of coffee, but he has beaten them all. He says there was one little asterisk on his record with Chris Benoit, but he proved last week that he too can be beaten. He says there comes a time that the animal turns around and bites the hand that fed him. He says that he will have to do the right thing, and lay the animal down, and put him to sleep…</p><p><b>Referee: Chad Patton<br>Edge and Christian vs. Jericho and Shelton Benjamin</b></p><p>The music of Chris Jericho hit in the arena as he made his way to the ring for this tag team match, teaming with the Intercontinental Champion, Shelton Benjamin, against former multiple time tag team champions, Edge and Christian, and all of these men will battle it out at WrestleMania 21 in the Money in the Bank Ladder Match for a future shot at the World Championship</p><p><b>The start:</b></p><p>Christian and Jericho started things off with a tie up.

It has a long list of names on the back with check marks on the back and the Undertaker’s name is checked off! He says he will NOT fall another victim to the Undertaker! A video package is shown of Randy Orton and all the legends he has taken down. After the package is shown he says in two weeks, his streak as a legend will be just like him… DEAD. The crowd boos. Randy Orton says that stacy is here now, there is something he has been wanting to do for a very long time… he grabs her hand and french kisses her on the lips (pics below), several times. He says he thrives on positive energy, and that is just why he will not listen to all the critics, he has a message for all the people that think the Undertaker is going to defeat him. The message is simply…. this…. Randy Orton then goes on to DROP STACY WITH THE RKO. Referees comes to the ring to help Stacy out as the CROWD BOOS heavily. J.R says that he would do this to his own girlfriend, God only knows what he will do to beat the Taker come WrestleMania 21.

Muhammed Hassan comes and talks to him saying he deserves to be at WrestleMania. He says they are a lot alike, both have faced diversity, but HBK knows nothing of what Hassan faces day in and day out. HBK says what he does not like is that Hassan claims he deserves everything, but he has earned nothing. Next week, in his home state, they will go one on one and face off, and he will show the world why they call him Mr. WrestleMania.</p><p>The lumberjacks head to the ring as HHH says that one of these guys could be the next member of Evolution…..</p><p><b>Lumberjack Match<br>Referee: Earl Hebner<br>Batista vs. Kane</b></p><p><b>Before the Match:</b></p><p>J.R informs HHH that he will be in a “face-off” next week in the ring against Batista.

On the other side of the ring, many men are beating on Batista, but as Kane rolls into the ring, Christian, Edge and Tomko beat on him! Outside the ring Batista goes buck wild and kills all the lumberjacks. He kills Chris Masters, tosses Maven into the steps, clotheslines one La Resiatance member into a flip and tosses the other down the ramp.
