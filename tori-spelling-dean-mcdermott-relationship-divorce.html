Fans wondered <a href=#>if Spelling and husband Dean McDermott were still talking</a> after they shared that they <strong>decided to separate in the summer of 2023</strong>. She is open about everything, from her finances to when her <a href=#>daughter Stella was upset about her plastic surgery</a>. It was only a matter of time before she would spill about her divorce.</p><p>According to People, when Tori Spelling <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launched her podcast misSPELLING</a></strong> in late March 2024, she shared a lot about wanting to file for divorce from Dean McDermott. While <a href=#>Hugh Jackman's divorce was the biggest in 2023</a>, at the time of this writing, Spelling and McDermott's divorce could be considered the most memorable of 2024. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the reason why Spelling waited almost 20 years to file for divorce</strong>, along with the years of divorce rumors that they experienced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-tori-spelling-stay-married-to-dean-mcdermott-even-though-she-wanted-to-divorce-him>Why Did Tori Spelling Stay Married To Dean McDermott Even Though She Wanted To Divorce Him?</h2><p>In her first podcast episode, Tori Spelling explained that she <strong>stayed married to Dean McDermott to "protect" their five children</strong>.

In fact, Spelling even admitted that something felt off in their relationship after four months together. Since they were married for 18 years, that means that she felt unhappy for years.</p><p>Spelling explained:</p><p>"Honestly, our relationship was never the same after we started having kids. We always said, ‘We won’t be those parents that change. We’ll make sure we make our relationship a priority, the two of us. We have date nights.’ And everything went out the window.
