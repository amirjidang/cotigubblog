After becoming famous thanks to High School Musical when he was in his late teens and early 20s, he began starring in comedies like That Awkward Moment and dramas like The Iron Claw and The Greatest Showman.</p><p>People are always curious about Zac Efron's relationships with his co-stars, from <a href=#>Jeremy Allen White's reaction to Efron's look</a> in the Iron Claw to whether <a href=#>Efron and Dwayne Johnson got along</a> while filming Baywatch.

Although Daddario has been in the spotlight since she played Annabeth Chase in Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief, she hasn't talked about her love life as much as other stars do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-3-2.jpg><p>In 2017, E! News reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daddario responded to the rumor</a> that she and Efron were dating. After sparks seemed to fly between the actors at the MTV Video & Movie Awards, fans wondered if there was something more to the story. She told E! News:</p><p>"We work together closely; he's my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zac Efron could also like keeping his relationships to himself. It's interesting that even though the world knew about his very public romance with his High School Musical co-star Vanessa Hudgens, they didn't confirm their romance for a while. Since Efron didn't want to tell the world who he was dating back then, it's possible that he felt the same way about Daddario.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-5.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Alexandra Daddario May Not Have Been Paid Well On True Detective But The Show Changed Her Net Worth Forever</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Alexandra Daddario credited her Hollywood success to her small role in True Detective, which may have not earned her a high salary at the time.</span><p>According to People, <strong>Hudgens and Efron began dating in 2005</strong>.
