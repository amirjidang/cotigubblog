Kathy Hilton and Kim and Kyle Richards rose to fame as child actresses in the '60s and '70s and ever since they have been known names in the entertainment industry. Nowadays, most people know them as reality television stars as all of them have appeared on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘RHOBH’ Star Kyle Richards Divorced Her First Husband Guraish Aldjufrie</a></span></p><p>Today, we're taking a look at just which sister is actually the richest. While all of them surely don't have to worry about money — there is quite a big difference in their current net worths!</p><h2 id=kim-richards-is-the-middle-sister-who-tends-to-stay-out-of-the-spotlight-nowadays><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kim Richards Is The Middle Sister Who Tends To Stay Out Of The Spotlight Nowadays</span></h2><p>Let's start off with the middle sister — 57-year-old Kim Richards. While some may remember her as a child actress from her roles in projects like Nanny and the Professor, Escape to Witch Mountain, and Return from Witch Mountain, most of the younger audience knows <a href=#>Kim from the reality television show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>. On the show, the actress would frequently fight with her younger sister Kyle and plenty still wonder <a href=#>what their relationship is like today</a>. Kim was a main cast member on the show from season one until season five after which she appeared as a guest in a few of the later seasons. Today, however, Kim Richards tends to stay out of the spotlight even though she updates her fans on her life through social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=currently-kim-is-estimated-to-have-a-net-worth-of-400-thousand><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Currently, Kim Is Estimated To Have A Net Worth Of $400 Thousand</span></h2><p>While Kim has been in the industry for multiple decades, her net worth today isn't too impressive. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Kim Richards <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is currently estimated to have a net worth of $400,000</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Predict The Cast Of RHOBH Season 12 As Filming Is Scheduled To Start In October</a></span></p><p>Kim was earning $100,000 per season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, however, it seems as if she used up a lot of that money.</p><h2 id=kyle-richards-is-the-youngest-sister-and-she-39-s-39-real-housewives-39-royalty><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kyle Richards Is The Youngest Sister And She's 'Real Housewives' Royalty</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's move on to the youngest sister in the family — 52-year-old Kyle Richards. Just like Kim, Kyle also <a href=#>rose to fame as a child actress</a> with roles in projects like Little House on the Prairie, The Car, Tobe Hooper's Eaten Alive, The Watcher In The Woods, and Halloween. However, a younger audience got to know Kyle thanks to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills where she has been a main cast member since season one. As fans of the show know, she is the only housewife who starred in all seasons of the show so far — which is why she is the most famous lady from the Beverly Hills show.</p><h2 id=kyle-is-estimated-to-be-worth-100-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kyle Is Estimated To Be Worth $100 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that Kyle has been on eleven seasons of the show it certainly doesn't come as a surprise that the reality television star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is currently estimated to have a net worth of $100 million</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which ‘RHOBH’ Star Has The Most Expensive Home In The Franchise?</a></span></p><p>Kyle gets paid a whopping $270,000 per season of the show so it's safe to say that she is very motivated to remain a cast member on it. The star is also very active on social media and those who follow her on Instagram can see plenty of glimpses into her life when she's not shooting The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><h2 id=kathy-hilton-is-the-eldest-richards-sister-and-also-the-mother-of-paris-and-nicky-hilton><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kathy Hilton Is The Eldest Richards Sister And Also The Mother Of Paris And Nicky Hilton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wrapping the list up is the eldest sister in the family — Kathy Hilton. While Kathy used to stay out of the spotlight throughout most of the seasons of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, she decided to join Kyle Richards as a cast member for the latest season of the show which aired earlier this year. However, while fans did get to see a lot of her on the last season, Kathy decided to <a href=#>join the show on a part-time basis</a>. As many probably know, Kathy Hilton is also the mother of reality television star Paris Hilton and fashion designer Nicky Hilton.</p><h2 id=and-with-a-net-worth-of-350-million-she-is-also-the-richest-sister-in-the-family><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And With A Net Worth Of $350 Million, She Is Also The Richest Sister In The Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Kim Richards doesn't have an incredibly impressive net worth and Kyle Richards can definitely brag about hers, the richest of the three sisters is by far Kathy Hilton. According to Celebrity Net Worth, the eldest sister in the family <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is currently estimated to have an impressive net worth of $350 million</a>. It's safe to say that fans got to know Kathy a lot better in the past couple of years and her relaxed attitude and impeccable humor which she showcases on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills have definitely made her a fan favorite!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>‘RHOBH’: Here’s Why Kim Richards And Lisa Rinna Had Drama About A Stuffed Bunny</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYlr%2Blv4ysoKyslafAbr7InJ%2Beq6Riu6bAjLCmq6yYYn9xfpBmqZ6ZnGK1sMHSnq6irpWoeqOx1Z6ppbFdnbatuNJmopqsmK56rLXMZqKypJVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichards-sisters-richest-net-worth-2021-real-housewives-beverly-hills-kathy-kim-kyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frichards-sisters-richest-net-worth-2021-real-housewives-beverly-hills-kathy-kim-kyle.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frichards-sisters-richest-net-worth-2021-real-housewives-beverly-hills-kathy-kim-kyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frichards-sisters-richest-net-worth-2021-real-housewives-beverly-hills-kathy-kim-kyle.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichards-sisters-richest-net-worth-2021-real-housewives-beverly-hills-kathy-kim-kyle.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichards-sisters-richest-net-worth-2021-real-housewives-beverly-hills-kathy-kim-kyle.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-richest-celebrity-couples-ranked.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-richest-celebrity-couples-ranked.html>The Richest Celebrity Couples, Ranked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ted-nugent-net-worth.html>Ted Nugent Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ted-nugent-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
