Moore attained his net worth through <a href=#>a series of successful, award-winning documentary films</a> that highlight issues in America like income inequality, problems with our healthcare system, and corruption from GOP elected officials. He is also a best-selling author and an occasional actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Danny Devito, Danny Glover, And The Biggest Celebrity Activists In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Moore’s first film, Roger and Me, highlighted the economic devastation caused by General Motors then-CEO Roger Smith‘s decision to shut down plants in Flint, Michigan, and earned Moore millions. His later film Bowling for Columbine, which highlighted gun violence in America, grossed $58 million at the box office and won an Academy Award. Moore’s magnum opus Fahrenheit 9/11 grossed over $200 million. Later films like Sicko and Capitalism: A Love Story would also yield respectable profits.</p><p>While some find it hypocritical that Moore advocates for working-class politics while being a self-described member of “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the 1%</a>” the truth is Moore lives very modestly with his wealth, and some might say benevolently. He spends very little on himself and stories of Michael Moore’s spending habits usually revolve around him donating to charitable or political causes. One is more likely to hear a story about Moore donating a few thousand dollars rather than hear about him splurging millions on private jets or fancy cars the way some other celebrities do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-donated-10-000-to-a-shakespeare-production><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Donated $10,000 To A Shakespeare Production</span></h2><p>A production of Shakespeare in the Park ran into controversy in 2017 when their presentation of Julius Caesar satirically lampooned former President Donald Trump as the title character. When Delta Air Lines and Bank of America backed out of the production as sponsors, Moore stepped in and fronted $10,000 allowing the play to continue, much to President Trump’s frustration.</p><h2 id=at-least-1000-to-planned-parenthood><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>At Least $1000 To Planned Parenthood</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moore ran a contest from his Twitter account promising a series of donations to anti-Trump organizations. Among on of the winners was Planned Parenthood, which received at least $1000 from Moore. However, while this donation might seem small compared to Moore’s impressive net worth, Moore is also a regular donor to Planned Parenthood and other such causes as he has privately contributed undisclosed amounts to the organization. Planned Parenthood provides reproductive health care services to underserved communities.</p><h2 id=he-also-gave-at-least-1-000-to-the-a-c-l-u><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Also Gave At Least $1,000 To The A.C.L.U.</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as Planned Parenthood, another organization to win in Moore’s Twitter contest was the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that seeks to protect the first amendment rights of all Americans. The organization saw an explosion of support following the election of Donald Trump, who some allege was using force to squash public dissent or criticism of his presidency, thus violating the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner's Embarrassing Run For Governor Of California</a></span></p><h2 id=moore-foundation-and-occupy-wall-street><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Moore Foundation And Occupy Wall Street</span></h2><p>As mentioned above, Michael Moore earned a healthy paycheck for Roger and Me, most of which Moore used to donate to groups supporting out-of-work automotive factory employees in Flint, Michigan, which is Moore’s hometown. He also started the Michael Moore Foundation with the funds. Since his success, Moore has donated undisclosed amounts to strike solidarity funds, and he provided extensive financial support to the efforts of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-000-to-an-anti-michael-moore-activist><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>$12,000 To An Anti-Michael Moore Activist</span></h2><p>Moore’s film Sicko was released in 2007 and highlighted the issues with America’s privately owned healthcare system. During the film, Moore learned that Jeff Kenefick, the administrator of the most visited anti-Michael Moore website, would be shutting down his work due to an inability to pay for his wife’s staggering medical bills. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moore, anonymously, sent the man a check for $12,000</a>, effectively covering the expenses and allowing the man to continue running his Michael Moore hate campaign. Although the donation was anonymous, Moore acknowledges the fact he did this in Sicko.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Are Asian Activists Mad At Tina Fey?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-gave-a-quarter-million-to-a-film-festival><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Gave A Quarter Million To A Film Festival</span></h2><p>Ever the patron of the arts, Moore and his then-wife Katelynn Glynn donated an impressive sum of approximately $250,000 to The Traverse City Film Festival in 2014 in honor of the success of his film Roger and Me. Allegedly, the money the festival received was the remaining funds from the Moore Foundation which was started with the money from Moore’s first film.</p><h2 id=we-may-never-know-how-much-he-actually-donates><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>We May Never Know How Much He Actually Donates</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are merely the donations that have been publicly disclosed by either the media or Moore himself. Moore famously does not spend much on clothes, as one can tell by his iconically disheveled baseball caps. His greatest known personal expense was his $5 million Michigan estate, which he sold in 2015 after he and his wife separated. Because charitable donations do not have to be disclosed, and because Moore tends to donate anonymously, as he acknowedges in Sicko, one may never really know where most of Moore’s money goes.</p><h2 id=what-we-know-about-his-political-donations><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What We Know About His Political Donations</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moore seems more interested in having the ability to donate to causes he supports rather than reinvest his money into stocks or entrepreneurial ventures. But thanks to websites like followthemoney.org, and the fact that political donations are disclosed by law, we do know that Moore donated somewhere between $7,000 and $10,000 in the 2018 election alone and has donated at least <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$25,000</a> to Democratic party candidates since 2008. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A frequent recipient of Moore’s contributions is Representative Rashida Tlaib,</a> a member of AOC’s famous “Squad” and an outspoken progressive from Moore’s state. These numbers only reflect his donations to individual candidates, not Political Action Committees or ballot measures. Say what one might about Moore, he uses his money to fight for what he believes in.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> Is SATC Star Cynthia Nixon Running For Office Again?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecyopqudXZm8pMHMnqWtmaKueqe1y6akmqOVYsCxsc2dqmZrYGK6qrjLoqanZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-moore-documentary-filmmake-spends-30-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichael-moore-documentary-filmmake-spends-30-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichael-moore-documentary-filmmake-spends-30-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichael-moore-documentary-filmmake-spends-30-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-moore-documentary-filmmake-spends-30-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-moore-documentary-filmmake-spends-30-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-elon-musk-felt-about-brief-relationship-with-amber-heard.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-elon-musk-felt-about-brief-relationship-with-amber-heard.html>How Elon Musk Really Felt About His Brief Relationship With Amber Heard</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cameron-diaz-matthew-perry-date-punch-aggressive-turn-memoir-famous-relationships.html>How Cameron Diaz And Matthew Perry's Date Took An Aggressive Turn</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cameron-diaz-matthew-perry-date-punch-aggressive-turn-memoir-famous-relationships.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
