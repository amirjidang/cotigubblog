However, he has not released any new music since 2016 and has not toured since 2018. In a 2017 interview, he said that he was “taking a break” from music, but he did not rule out a return to the stage in the future.</p><p>There are a few possible reasons why Cetera has not released any new music in recent years. One possibility is that he is simply enjoying his retirement. He has said that he is spending more time with his family and friends, and he is also enjoying pursuing other interests, such as painting and photography.</p><p>Another possibility is that Cetera is not happy with the current state of the music industry. He has been critical of the way that music is consumed and distributed in the digital age, and he has said that he is not sure if he can find a way to make music that he is happy with in the current climate.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-cetera-leave-chicago></span>Why did Cetera leave Chicago?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Peter Cetera left Chicago in 1985 to pursue a solo career.

Cetera was reportedly unhappy with the way that the band was being managed, and he felt that he was not being given enough creative control.</p><p>Family. Cetera had two young children at the time, and he wanted to spend more time with them.</p><p>Cetera’s departure from Chicago was a major blow to the band, as he was one of their most popular members.
