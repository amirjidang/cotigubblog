But unlike many other celebrities, Keanu likes to keep a low profile, so not much is generally known about his relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, fans have learned a lot <a href=#>about Keanu's tragic past</a>, including the loss of his daughter and ex-girlfriend.</p><p>And sure, Jennifer Syme dated Keanu Reeves while she was alive, but who was she, and what did she do when not being photographed out with Reeves?</p><h2 id=jennifer-syme-worked-in-hollywood>Jennifer Syme Worked In Hollywood</h2><p>Before she met Keanu, Jennifer Syme was already rubbing elbows with plenty of Hollywood greats. In fact, one of her first gigs was working for director David Lynch.</p><p>After that, Jennifer worked as a personal assistant to a handful of famous folks, including rocker Dave Navarro. Working behind the scenes wasn't her only goal, though; Syme also appeared on screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Syme played a "junkie girl" in a 1997 film, also acting as a production assistant on the film. She would later receive a production assistant credit for one episode of a TV show, then was posthumously credited in a 2005 film in which she played "casting chick."</p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-39-girlfriend-knew-marilyn-manson>Keanu Reeves' Girlfriend Knew Marilyn Manson</h2><p>Jennifer was, apparently, well-connected enough to make friends with various celebrities, including Marilyn Manson. In fact, the night she passed away, she had just gotten home from (and was apparently returning to) Marilyn's house, where a party was happening.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>One Fan Who Dated Him Says This Is What Keanu Reeves Is Really Like In Person</a></span></p><p>Syme's mother later filed charges against Manson, alleging that it was his fault Jennifer drove while under the influence. In fact, Syme's mother accused Manson of encouraging her daughter to get in her car and drive that night.</p><p>As many already know, Syme <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away</a> after crashing her Jeep into various parked vehicles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reports later confirmed that she was under the influence during the accident, and was also not wearing a seatbelt. However, Manson denied any wrongdoing or involvement at all in Jennifer's passing.</p><p>Jennifer, who a friend of Keanu's called "sweet," was thrown from the vehicle and apparently died on impact.</p><h2 id=keanu-learned-jennifer-had-passed-away-by-calling-the-coroner>Keanu Learned Jennifer Had Passed Away By Calling The Coroner</h2><p>At least one source reported that Keanu found out that his ex-girlfriend had passed away by calling the local coroner's office the morning after her accident.</p><p>Many fans found it interesting that Keanu would be checking up on his ex, but as it turns out, the two had only seen one another the day prior. The two had brunch together the day before Keanu would call the coroner looking for the mother of his child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their breakup, Jennifer and Keanu were apparently still close, though grief over the loss of their stillborn baby allegedly caused their split.</p><p>After Syme's passing, a friend told journalists that Keanu was "finding it very, very difficult to cope," which later led to his reputation of having a traumatic past.</p><h2 id=jennifer-syme-was-dealing-with-personal-struggles>Jennifer Syme Was Dealing With Personal Struggles</h2><p>News sources <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that Syme had been treated for depression shortly before her passing, but also that she had two prescriptions in the vehicle, as well as a white powdery substance, upon her death.</p><p>Fans may recall that late 1999 was when Syme gave birth to her daughter with Keanu, and the pair split a few weeks later. However, the accident occurred in 2001, with Syme passing away in April.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer was buried next to her daughter, sources confirm, leaving Keanu "heartbroken" and "in pain." And for a long time, no one really knew whether Keanu was dating anyone.</p><p>Plus, over the years, "sad Keanu" memes have surfaced, perpetuating the idea that Keanu has been sad and alone ever since his ex-girlfriend passed away. While he clearly mourned her and the two were close, Keanu seems to be doing well enough in life these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s How Keanu Reeves Spends His $360 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>He maintains a positive outlook on life and fame and often donates time and money to worthwhile causes. Not to mention, Keanu seems to have found love with Alexandra Grant, who helped him create two books featuring her photographs and his poetry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the tragedies in his earlier life, Keanu is still an icon to fans, both for his acting repertoire and <a href=#>how wholesome he seems</a> as a human in general. From his kind attitude toward fans to his willingness to live like an average person rather than a millionaire super-celeb, there are plenty of reasons why fans love Keanu.</p><p>And it's nice to see him happy with someone, especially because not many of his relationships have been publicized. Yes, his relationships are his business -- but fans are glad he finally found some happiness after losing someone he loved.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Real Reason Keanu Reeves Hasn’t Made Alexandra Grant His Wife</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecmepaehlpq%2Fbr%2FYppxmo5WWu7Z50Z6cr52jYrmiwMRmnLFll56%2FrbLRopynnF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-jennifer-syme-keanu-reeves-late-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-jennifer-syme-keanu-reeves-late-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-jennifer-syme-keanu-reeves-late-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-jennifer-syme-keanu-reeves-late-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-jennifer-syme-keanu-reeves-late-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-jennifer-syme-keanu-reeves-late-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-did-will-arnett-just-have-a-baby-with.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-did-will-arnett-just-have-a-baby-with.html>Will Arnett Is A Dad Of Three, With Two Divorces.
