Despite being a pretty blonde girl, she didn't date much in school. "I was always into older men as a teenager," Heard said. "I never dated in my school. That was a ridiculous idea to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We Know About Amber Heard Since The Johnny Depp Scandal</a></span></p><p>After her best friend died in a car crash <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she turned to atheism and books by Ayn Rand</a> and George Orwell. "I’ve read all of her books," Heard said. "Ever since then, I have been obsessed with her ideals. All I’ve ever needed is myself." She later dropped out of high school and pursued a career in modeling, but still earned her diploma through a home school program.</p><p>She worked as a lifeguard and as a maid at a modeling agency to earn enough money to start a modeling portfolio. At age 17 she had the money to move to New York to professionally start her modeling career, having the experience&nbsp;from beauty pageants. Her father gave her a .38 gun with a fine pearl handle as a goodbye present.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-quit-modeling-and-tried-acting>She Quit Modeling And Tried Acting</h2><p>Heard moved to L.A. to begin her acting career and even though she had no contacts or connections, she was able to get auditions. She scored a role in Friday Night Lights in 2004 and after that appeared in several projects per year, including North Country as Charlize Theron's younger self.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Photos Amber Heard Probably Regrets Today</a></span></p><p>Her first leading role was in the horror film, All the Boys Love Mandy Lane. After that, she also starred in eight episodes of Hidden Palms, for which she had to lose 25 pounds to play&nbsp;Greta Matthews.</p><p>All the hard work and continuous projects seemed to be paying off because she landed two breakout roles in 2008, one in Never Back Down, as Baja Miller, the lead's hot girlfriend, and another in Pineapple Express, as Angie Anderson, Seth Rogen's girlfriend. &nbsp;Later on, she played in The Informers, The Joneses, and Zombieland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=depp-hand-picked-her-for-the-rum-diary-and-they-had-immediate-chemistry>Depp Hand-Picked Her For The Rum Diary And They Had Immediate Chemistry</h2><p>Before she ever met Depp, she reportedly had a similar scandalous relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree, who she met in 2008. Heard didn't open up about the affair until appearing at a GLAAD party. In 2009 Heard grabbed van Ree's arm for which she was arrested and detained for misdemeanor domestic violence.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos That Paint Amber Heard In A Different Light</a></span></p><p>The charges were dismissed however after van Ree called them misunderstood. But when Heard beat out Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley for Chenault in The Rum Diary and&nbsp;was hand-picked by Depp himself, her romance with van Ree went out the window.</p><p>The pair had immediate chemistry, which turned romantic and ruined Depp's 14-year-old partnership with Vanessa Paradis. After The Rum Diary, as we know, the pair started dating and later got married on his private island.</p><p>Soon after, she was always in the news about things she was doing with Depp and the blockbuster films she was getting at the time, including 3 Days to Kill,&nbsp;Magic Mike XXL, The Danish Girl, Justice League, and Aquaman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heard has struggled with being typecast as the pretty blonde and has spoken out about how Hollywood has very limited female roles. No doubt her father taught her to fight for things she believes in and it seems like she'll stick to her guns no matter what, even in the face of scandal and defamation.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Amber Heard And Johnny Depp's Current Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecCmmZ6qXZ2yor7DZpmenp%2Bnsm65wKupsqGenHqru8enpbJllJq9sXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-amber-heard-before-marrying-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-amber-heard-before-marrying-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-amber-heard-before-marrying-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-amber-heard-before-marrying-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-amber-heard-before-marrying-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-amber-heard-before-marrying-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./golden-bachelor-finalist-theresa-nist-6-things-to-know.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./golden-bachelor-finalist-theresa-nist-6-things-to-know.html>'Golden Bachelor' Finalist Theresa Nist: 6 Things to Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-nikki-battistes-husband-dean-simpson-407984-html.html>Who Is Nikki Battistes Husband, Dean Simpson?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-nikki-battistes-husband-dean-simpson-407984-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
