George later divorced her.</p><p>Richey was a songwriter, manager, publisher, and record producer. Although he was born in Arkansas, Malden, Missouri, was where he was raised. Through his songwriting and record-making, Richey has been a mainstay of the Nashville country music scene since the 1960s.</p><p>He was most known to the younger Nasvillans as Tammy Wynette’s fifth, last, and longest-married husband. However, he played several other noteworthy roles throughout his lengthy Nashville career</p><p>While married to Wynette, he served as her full-time manager and occasional producer and songwriter. After she passed away in 1998, he pretty much disappeared from public view.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="A Look At George Richey and His Wife Sheila Richey Relationship">A Look At George Richey and His Wife Sheila Richey Relationship</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="George Richey Relationship With Tammy Wynette">George Richey Relationship With Tammy Wynette</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-look-at-george-richey-and-his-wife-sheila-richey-relationship></span>A Look At George Richey and His Wife Sheila Richey Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1974, George Richey married his wife Sheila Richey but she&nbsp;sought a divorce in 1977 after three years.</p><p>The divorce was based on “cruel and inhuman treatment,” which she later dropped.</p><p>The term “cruel, inhuman, or humiliating&nbsp;treatment or punishment” encompasses more than only torture. It frequently refers to methods of treatment that are less harsh than torture or do not fall under the definition of torture.</p><p>There is no definite evidence that George tormented her. After learning that Richey was in a relationship with Tammy Wynette, he filed for divorce again around October 1977.</p><p>Before them, George married Dorothy Ann Tippit, his first wife, in 1953. They have two kids together: a son named Kelly and a daughter named Diedre. However, Richey and Trippet separated in 1969 after being married for more than ten years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=george-richey-relationship-with-tammy-wynette></span>George Richey Relationship With Tammy Wynette<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>George Richey was best known for being Tammy Wynette’s fifth, and longest-lasting husband.</p><p>Tammy got to share the amazing news of her marriage to George Richey in the epilogue of her autograph, dated one month after their wedding in July 1978.</p><p>Her&nbsp;statement&nbsp;describes how they’d been friends for so long that it amazed her to realize she’d fallen in love with him. How liberating it felt to hand over control of her home, finances, and career to Richey so she could concentrate exclusively on music.</p><p>We will never be able to know how much he may have contributed to her staging any of those incidents.</p><p>Several sources claim that Richey and Wynette faked her kidnapping two months after the writing of this epilogue, even before the book was even released, to explain away the physical proof of a beating she allegedly suffered at the hands of Richey.</p><p>Before meeting him, Tammy was quite close to her&nbsp;ex-husband&nbsp;George Jones. They wed in 1969 and divorced in 1975. In country music, they were the original power couple. They created some great music due to the love and heartbreak that defined their relationship.</p><p>In 1968, while Wynette was still married to Don Chapel, a former songwriter and hotel clerk, Jones and Wynette first encountered each other in a Nashville recording studio.</p><p>Wynette married Jones in February 1969, following the dissolution of her union with Chapel. Both of their careers in country music were thriving, and Wynette’s single “Stand By Your Man” had become a hit.</p><p>The pair reportedly changed their names to “Mr. and Mrs. Country Music” and relocated to Lakeland, Florida, according to the New York Times.</p><p>On October 5, 1970, Wynette and Jones gave birth to Tamela Georgette Jones, their lone child together. In addition, Wynette and Jones each had three children from previous marriages.</p><p>Even after their divorce, Wynette and Jones kept making music and touring. Three years before Wynette’s untimely passing at age 55, their final album, “One,” was released in 1995.</p><p>The country couple’s relationship is now being immortalized in a six-episode limited series called “George and Tammy,” about the country duo’s romance, which debuted on Paramount+ on December 4.</p><p>Wynette is portrayed by actress Jessica Chastain, while Michael Shannon plays the role of Jones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BVpL%2BosYyroJygla56orrDZp%2Biq12btrO%2F02auop6VYsCpscilmGarnJbCqLTTnqlmqpmYtabFjLCcp6xdqbWzu9Sgn2aZXanCs67UpZynrF2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-richey-and-his-first-wife-sheila-slaughter-richey-went-through-a-turbulent-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgeorge-richey-and-his-first-wife-sheila-slaughter-richey-went-through-a-turbulent-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-richey-and-his-first-wife-sheila-slaughter-richey-went-through-a-turbulent-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgeorge-richey-and-his-first-wife-sheila-slaughter-richey-went-through-a-turbulent-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-richey-and-his-first-wife-sheila-slaughter-richey-went-through-a-turbulent-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-richey-and-his-first-wife-sheila-slaughter-richey-went-through-a-turbulent-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./haloti-ngata-net-worth-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./haloti-ngata-net-worth-2.html>Haloti Ngata Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gavin-maloofs-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Gavin Maloofs Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gavin-maloofs-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
