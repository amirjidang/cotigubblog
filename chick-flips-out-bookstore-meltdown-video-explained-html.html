After it was posted on The Shade Room, I was so taken by the woman that I needed to hear her story.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-2-0-3@published data-word-count=123>First, I contacted the Generic Theater in Norfolk, Virginia, whose YouTube page first posted the video to promote a run of an adaptation of Stephen King’s <i>Misery.</i> They directed me to Jon Bremner, the show’s director, who first had the idea to shoot the video, and Celia Burnett, the star of the short, who at the time was the theater’s costume designer and, unsurprisingly, one of the actresses set to play Annie Wilkes in the show. This past weekend, we spoke on the phone about how the shoot went down, how it first went viral, what it’s like to have people <i>still</i> debate whether it’s real, and exactly who was in on it. But, first, here is the clip one last cockadoodie time:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-4-0-0@published data-word-count=128><b>How did this all start?<br></b><strong>Jon Bremner:</strong> I was sitting at a production meeting for the show and said, “I have a good relationship with the Barnes & Noble engagement manager, and they’ve given us full access to do whatever we want for a day.” We had just done a zombie flash-mob there and it was wildly successful. And when I was in charge of putting my own show together, I really wanted to activate that connection. When I met with the community engagement manager, I said, “Would you mind if we had someone flipping out screaming at your counter?” She asked what was happening, and after I explained the concept of the video she was like, “That’s awesome.” As far as approvals was concerned, that was it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-5-0-0@published data-word-count=121><b>That worked out. Celia, how did you react when asked?<br></b><b>Celia Burnett:</b> I thought it was a good idea. What’s interesting is that Jonathan double cast the show: There were two Pauls and two Annies. And I remember people talking about how I was the only one who had improv experience, so I should be the person who does it. Katy, who was the other Annie, said to me, “Wow. You can improv? That’s amazing. I can’t wait to take an improv class and learn how to do it.” And if I had been on my toes that day, I would’ve been like, “Katy, for $1,000 I’ll teach you how to improv.” But I didn’t. A great regret of my life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-6-0-0@published data-word-count=51><b>How did you prepare for the shoot?<br></b><strong>JB:</strong> We wanted it to look candid, so we didn’t plan on having any lights, and we didn’t want a fancy camera. The only thing we did was put a microphone behind the counter. Then we talked to Celia for maybe like five minutes.&nbsp;<b></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-7-0-0@published data-word-count=45><strong>CB:</strong> All the staff knew that it was going to happen.

He volunteered. He was ecstatic to do it. We ran it once where there was no screaming. Then we talked for like a minute to go through good things for him to say. I asked if we could use a computer, knowing that sometimes at Barnes & Noble, if they don’t have a book, they’ll ask to get it at another store.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-9-0-0@published data-word-count=36><b>Were there other plants?<br></b><strong>JB:</strong> Right before we shot, I grabbed people who were on the crew and had them standing in line.

So I hoped no one would freak out. But when I was doing it, I wasn’t worried about anything. I was just doing it.

That came when the drag queen&nbsp;Mimi Imfurst&nbsp;in New York shared the video.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-17-0-0@published data-word-count=64><b>Wait, really!?</b><br><strong>JB:</strong> She just happened to find it on YouTube. That’s when it started with, “Hey y’all, there’s something here that you don’t get.” That’s how Mimi framed it, and she had enough of a following that the rule of powers took effect. I have a friend who knew her, so I was able to reach out and thank her for sharing it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-18-0-0@published data-word-count=93><b>Did you expect people to not understand what’s going on?<br></b><strong>CB:</strong> I realized not too long after the play was over and saw the comments. Some people were familiar with the character, saying, “Oh yeah, that’s fake.” And there are some people who think it’s completely real, which is so freaky. People putting comments like “Who the hell is Paul Sheldon?” The weirdest thing to me are the people who think that I just decided to pretend to be Annie Wilkes and go into this bookstore and bother these people while they’re working.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-19-0-0@published data-word-count=82><strong>JB:</strong> From my end, it was totally intentional, from the camera choices to how we held the camera to the type of lens we used. Everything was chosen to make it look like a cell phone in someone’s hand. And the title was very intentionally misleading to give it that viral punch. “Crazy chick flips out in Barnes & Noble,” because that’s what a cell-phone passerby would’ve labeled the video, as opposed to a production team that had thrown this together intentionally.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-20-0-0@published data-word-count=45><strong>CB:</strong> Every four or six months someone will say something like, “My cousin in Michigan sent me this video that she said was hilarious, but it was you.” Or I just saw something that was like “the five craziest customers” and there’s my freaking face.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-21-0-0@published data-word-count=51><strong>JB:</strong> I’ve been trying to track the total number of views, and it’s become impossible at this point. The only confirmed number I can actually give is 25 million between Facebook unique shares and the original YouTube video. At this point, it’s got to be somewhere around 40 or 50 million.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e9707d104703619cc8a7101ff0d0c4c6-22-0-0@published data-word-count=80><b>It recently went viral again because The Shade Room posted it.
