With all the long studio hours recording, the constant partying, the long stretches of touring, it becomes very easy to let yourself go, gain a lot of weight and adopt an unhealthy lifestyle. As we all know, losing weight and getting healthy require a lot of discipline, determination and dedication. In the following article, we present to you 8 rappers who took their weight challenge on head first and stayed on course to attain their goals. It's actually quite inspirational to see how they persisted and prevailed. Enjoy the article below ...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rick-ross><strong>Rick Ross:</strong></h2><p>Rapper <a title="Rick Ross Net Worth" href=#>Ricky Rozay</a> is undoubtedly one of the biggest bosses in the Hip-Hop game today. He is certainly the king of the Miami Hip-Hop scene and he’s slated to drop his new album Hood Billionaire at the end of the year. Ross is also making some adjustments to his weight and health. He has always been an overweight individual but he recently lost about a 100lb by doing a fitness regimen he calls “RossFit.” He hits the treadmill, does weight training and he has added more fruits and healthy vegetables to his diet. He has suffered serious seizures in the past, so this is definitely a step in the right direction.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=missy-elliott><strong>Missy Elliott:</strong></h2><p>43-yr-old rapper/songwriter/producer &nbsp;<a title="Missy Elliott Net Worth" href=#>Missy Elliott</a> is an iconic figure in the world of rap and R&B. Her production partner is the Grammy winning music maestro <a title="Timbaland Net Worth" href=#>Timbaland</a>, and together these two have crafted hits for major names like <a title="Aaliyah Net Worth" href=#>Aaliyah</a>, Total, <a title="Ciara Net Worth" href=#>Ciara</a>, <a title="Mariah Carey Net Worth" href=#>Mariah Carey</a> and <a title="Keyshia Cole Net Worth" href=#>Keyshia Cole</a>. From the beginning of her career, she has always had a weight issue, but not anymore. In 2002, after a doctor warned her of possible heart issues, she lost 70lb by following a strict diet that limited fried foods, bread and sugar. She stepped out on the scene this past October looking very svelte after losing an additional 30lb. She later tweeted that she had been eating healthy and training with celeb fitness training, Shaun T.</p><p></p><h2 id=mack-10><strong>Mack 10:</strong></h2><p>Rapper Mack 10 was a major fixture on the West Coast gangsta rap scene from the mid to late nineties. He was even in a top selling group called the Westside Connection which also included the one and only <a title="Ice Cube Net Worth" href=#>Ice Cube</a>.&nbsp; Even back then, Mack 10 was a really chubby guy, but if you see him now, he’s looking very slim and trim. At his heaviest, Mack 10 weighed about 270lb, but now he weighs less than 200lb. When&nbsp; asked by TMZ about his transformation, he replied that, “I used to love to be able to order a burger or get a fat ass steak, but now I am up on eating fish, chicken and s**t.”&nbsp; Good for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=fat-joe><strong>&nbsp;Fat Joe:</strong></h2><p><a title="Fat Joe Net Worth" href=#>Fat Joe</a>’s weight loss is one of the more remarkable examples of a rapper using sheer determination and will power to make a positive change in his life. At one point in his career, Fat Joe weighed 430lb, but this didn’t stop him from attaining fame and success. But then he saw the light, and after a heavy regimen of exercising and dieting, he’s now close to 250lb. When asked about his weight loss by MTV news, this is what he said: “It’s all about education and knowledge, feeding yourself and knowing that too much carbs is what gets us fat.</p><p>PS: If you haven’t yet, check out Fat Joe’s &nbsp;brand new single “Stressin" featuring Jennifer Lopez. It’s a really good club track.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-wall><strong>&nbsp;Paul Wall:</strong></h2><p>In the mid aughts, Texas rapper <a title="Paul Wall Net Worth" href=#>Paul Wall</a> made a huge splash on the scene with tracks like “Sittin’ Sidewayz” and “Grillz.” But all the time he was blowing up, his weight was ballooning out of control too. It got to the point where he decided to make a change, and he opted to go the route of getting a gastric sleeve surgery. This medical procedure helped him lose about a 100lb, and presently Paul Wall is about half his original size. He’s much healthier as a result of it too. Well done.</p><p></p><h2 id=scarface><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Scarface:</strong></h2><p>Rapper Brad Jordan aka <a title="Scarface Net Worth" href=#>Scarface</a> is one of the most respected rappers in the Hip-Hop game. He has been around since the early 90s when he was part of the group Geto Boys. In his solo career, he has enjoyed major success and done songs with <a title="Tupac Shakur Net Worth" href=#>TuPac</a>, <a title="Jay Z Net Worth" href=#>Jay-Z</a> and more. However in the last few years, his weight was spiraling out of control and he weighed almost 291lb. As he stated in an interview, this weight issue was seriously affecting his health, “I had it all: congestive heart failure, malignant high blood pressure, kidney damage, enlarged heart, sleep apnea, borderline diabetic, etc. My life was threatened. So if someone in the street threatens my life, he better make good on it. Because I have to kill him or he’s going to kill me. So I had to kill bad health.” Scarface now weighs closer to 180lbs – congrats to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=50-cent><strong>50 Cent:</strong></h2><p><a title="50 Cent Net Worth" href=#>50 Cent</a>’s weight loss is probably the most dramatic in this list for two main reasons. First of all, he dropped so much weight in a very short amount of time (nine weeks). Secondly he didn’t do it for health reasons – it was for a movie role he had been casted in. So how did he go from 214lb to 160lb in such a short time? He maintained a strictly liquid diet and he ran on the treadmill for 3 hours a day. Now that’s what you call some serious dedication and determination!</p><p></p><h2 id=mike-jones><strong>Mike Jones:</strong></h2><p>Houston rapper <a title="Mike Jones Net Worth" href=#>Mike Jones</a> also came on the scene in 2005, and he quickly caught on because of his laid back rapping style and a unique marketing ploy: he would give out his real cell phone number on his records and his fans loved this! He disappeared from the scene for a few years and when he resurfaced in 2010, he had lost over a 100lb and the rumor mills would not let this issue die. There were reports of him being sick with AIDS and being addicted to hard drugs. However the rapper stated himself in an interview that he was losing weight to get healthy. He said: “I was almost 300lb. I lost almost a 100lb – That goes from eating Subway, running on the treadmill and watching what I eat.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZnFlopa9sbHRrGSwoJ9iubC%2F02afrp%2BVYq6uu9Snq6xln5t6uLHIoJ%2BtZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-rappers-who-lost-huge-amounts-of-weight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f8-rappers-who-lost-huge-amounts-of-weight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f8-rappers-who-lost-huge-amounts-of-weight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f8-rappers-who-lost-huge-amounts-of-weight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-rappers-who-lost-huge-amounts-of-weight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-rappers-who-lost-huge-amounts-of-weight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alicia-keys-pregnant-with-second-child-see-her-bump-2014317.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alicia-keys-pregnant-with-second-child-see-her-bump-2014317.html>Alicia Keys Pregnant, Expecting Second Child With Swizz Beatz</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./17-favorite-boho-swimsuits-bikinis-for-summer-amazon.html>17 Flattering Boho-Chic Swimsuits on Amazon for Summer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./17-favorite-boho-swimsuits-bikinis-for-summer-amazon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
