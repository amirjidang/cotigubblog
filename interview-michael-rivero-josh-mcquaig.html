Josh started his marketing career as an intern and quickly realized he had the unique ability to apply marketing principles and close gaps of communication between consumers and their clients. Together Michael and Josh have built TopShotPro to what it is today in less than 1 year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for joining us! Can you tell us a story about what brought you to start your digital marketing <a href=#>business</a>?</strong></p><p><strong><a href=#>TopShotPro</a></strong> is more than just a Digital Marketing Business it’s the first of it’s kind in Digital Branding & Marketing for Real Estate Agents & Loan Officers. Together we worked for a fortune 500 Digital Marketing Agency and noticed a gap between customer service and customer success. This gap led us to start TopShotPro as a Full Digital Branding & Marketing Agency which focuses on customer success.</p><p><strong>How did you get your idea or concept for the business?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>What we noticed is, realtors & loan officers have one unique job. Help people buy/sell their home. So for them focusing on marketing should be directed by someone within their team or someone who understands their market and is able to help them get more brand awareness, visibility and leads. This need for a marketing team who understands their day to day activities helped the TopShotPro team create and implement the D.E.F.Y (Do Everything For You)&nbsp; Strategy. This is the strategy in mind that led TopShotPro to service Realtors & Loan Officers with their social media, production and advertising needs.</p><p><strong>How many people work for you currently?</strong></p><p>As a start-up, we currently have 3 Full Timers. Michael Rivero, Josh McQuaig and Kevin Tanner</p><p>We also have 2 Social Media Managers, 1 Email Marketing Partner, and several consultants for different aspects of the business.</p><p><strong>What advice would you have for other new entrepreneurs?</strong></p><p>If your gut feeling tells you to do something, do it. Don’t think about it just do it! It’s easy to say no to yourself just as it is to say yes. They both take the same amount of energy, so you’re better off putting energy towards building something productive that will make you happy or will teach you something.</p><p><strong>Read more related:</strong> <strong><a href=#>Entrepreneur interviews&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p><strong>What are your major services and how people can take benefit from it?</strong></p><p>All of our services play a role in client marketing, however, we do build custom strategies to have starting points with each of them.</p><p>Our Core services the fit and benefit most clients are…</p><ul><li>Content Marketing</li><li>Video Marketing</li><li>Branding Strategy</li><li>Social Media Management</li><li>Advertising</li></ul><p>Our clients benefit most from these services by having a holistic approach to their content marketing efforts while advancing the process of knowledge, like & trust for their brand. Together these services expedite the process of relationship-building giving our clients a unique capability to reach 1000s when they usually have 1:1 relationships only.</p><p><strong>If you were given another chance to choose your career field, what would you choose?</strong></p><p>Michael: I would just get started on the marketing company earlier than I did. Marketing is the intersection of Brand & Sales. Now if I could do anything in this world, just thinking as a kid here I would be a professional soccer player.</p><p>Josh: From a very early age, I knew I wanted something stable. Not in the sense that I wanted comfort & a stable paycheck, more so enter a field where that isn’t so heavily dependent on one thing or another (ie the economy). That’s how I chose marketing in the first place, so it would have to be something within marketing still… (or a loan officer)</p><p><strong>Who supported you the most in your life?</strong></p><p>Michael: I’ve been blessed to be raised with love and my family although sometimes we’ve disagreed they’ve always been supportive of my goals and dreams. My mom and dad are both big fans of TopShotPro and are constantly asking me how we’re doing and asking what the next milestones are going to be!</p><p>Josh: My parents have hands down been the best support system that I could have ever asked for… My dad is very entrepreneurial and he sees it in me as well. My mom, being the husband of an entrepreneur knows the game as well, so there has been nothing but support from them.</p><p><strong>Which books do you read and recommend to get inspiration and motivation?<br></strong><br>Michael: I’d have to recommend 3 books which changed my life completely</p><li>The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ Demarco</li><li>The Game – Neil Strauss</li><li>10X Rule – Grant Cardone</li><p>Josh: 10x Rule by Grant Cardone. It’s great for inspiration & motivation to strive and be better overall, mentally, physically & emotionally. Another would be, Donald Millers Building a Story Brand. This helps out with clear communication Willpower Doesn’t Work by Benjamin Hardy</p><p><strong>What are your future plans?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Michael: Well for the rest of 2020 we are working on crossing the $1M mark in revenue once we cross that line we’ll be able to begin working on additional projects and extension companies of TopShotPro. 2021 we’ll see the start of TopShotProperties and who knows, 10 years from now we do envision having a hub across the US and honestly, the world is our oyster if we apply ourselves with enough will power and commitment to each other and to the business.</p><p>Josh: Future plans with TopShotPro is to grow into different cities in the US – Primarily Los Angeles, New York & Miami & Become to go to Real Estate Digital Branding & Digital Marketing</p><p><strong>How people should contact you?</strong></p><p>Michael: people can find me on Instagram <strong><a href=#>@topshotdc</a></strong> or connect with me on LinkedIn <strong><a href=#>@Michael Rivero</a></strong></p><p>Josh:&nbsp; you can find me on Instagram <strong><a href=#>@joshhmcquaig</a></strong> and join my professional network on LinkedIn @<strong><a href=#>Josh McQuaig</a></strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC1za2cq66ZmsRuucicn5qdnGK%2FqsLEq6Zmop%2BotW65wqqsmqGXZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finterview-michael-rivero-josh-mcquaig.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finterview-michael-rivero-josh-mcquaig.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finterview-michael-rivero-josh-mcquaig.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finterview-michael-rivero-josh-mcquaig.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finterview-michael-rivero-josh-mcquaig.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finterview-michael-rivero-josh-mcquaig.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./naomi-campbell-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./naomi-campbell-net-worth.html>Naomi Campbell Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./madison-elizabeth-mcmahon-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-302156-html.html>Madison Elizabeth McMahon Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Bi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./madison-elizabeth-mcmahon-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-302156-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
