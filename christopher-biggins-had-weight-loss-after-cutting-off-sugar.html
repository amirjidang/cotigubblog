The television personality got depressed after he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and he worried about his mortality. So, he changed his diet, cut off sugar completely, incorporated light exercises (walking) into his daily life, and lost weight. Christopher Biggins has maintained his weight loss very well.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>Christopher Biggins</span> is truly an icon solely for how he brings to life his comedic pantomime characters. Though he is a household name and face as an <span><span>actor</span></span> and also has been in numerous reality <span><span>television shows</span></span>, he is mostly known for being the ultimate pantomime king. One of his most memorable roles is of <span>Widow Twankey</span> in the pantomime production of Aladdin and Lukewarm in the sitcom <span>Porridge</span>.</p><p>Christopher Biggins has enjoyed a long career. He has spent more than 50 years in the entertainment industry. People have watched him play small characters before heading on to bigger roles. And they have watched him move on to reality shows before he took up pantomime. The point is, they have been with him all along the ride so they wouldn’t miss even if a hair was out of place with him. As such, they would never miss the weight loss he has had in the last few years. So, let’s talk about it!</p><p>There are more <span><span>weight loss</span></span> stories of <span><span>Robert Crampton</span></span> and <span><span>Jenny Ryan ‘The Vixen’</span></span> that you might like.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-biggins-weight-loss-he-had-to-change-his-lifestyle-after-being-diagnosed-with-diabetes></span>Christopher Biggins’ Weight Loss: He Had to Change His Lifestyle After Being Diagnosed With Diabetes!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Christopher Biggins</span> (<span>@biggins.christopher</span>) changed his lifestyle for the sake of his health and it ended up resulting in his dramatic weight loss of about <span>16 pounds</span>.</p><p>If people had forgotten what Biggins looked like, I’m sure they now remember after watching him on the <span>special celebrity edition</span> of <span>Escape to the Country</span> that aired recently. If you are thinking that he has gotten thin recently after that episode, you are wrong about that because he’s been losing weight over the last few years. His weight loss transformation is definitely nothing new.</p><p>Christopher Biggins has been getting on to the slimmer side of things ever since he brought a change in his lifestyle to make adjustments to some health conditions. In a 2019 interview, he opened up about everything he did that led to the <span>change in his physique and appearance</span>. Though he did not specifically aim to shed weight when he changed his way of living, it resulted in his weight loss which got a lot of people talking.</p><p>In 2010, the television personality was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes which worried him very much for his life. He got a different perspective on life and his health after being aware of how he was susceptible to heart attacks and other health problems. That revelation prompted Christopher Biggins to make changes to his way of living and prioritize his health which ultimately led to his weight loss. At first, he was depressed but he eventually dealt with it in the best way possible.</p><p><span><span>It rather depressed me and I very rarely get depressed. I thought, ‘Oh dear, this is sort of the beginning of the end’. Knowing that I’m twice as likely to have a stroke or a heart attack because I have type 2 diabetes is sobering.</span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-did-christopher-biggins-do-for-weight-loss></span>What Did Christopher Biggins Do For Weight Loss?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Keeping his health and the fact that he had Type 2 diabetes in mind, Biggins completely changed his diet and he also started doing light exercises. He began to pay attention to what he ate for the first time in his life. And that simple but significant dietary changes he made not just did wonders for his health condition but turned out to be great for his physique as well. He is no longer pot-bellied like before because of his weight loss. Speaking of the change, <span>Christopher Biggins</span> said,</p><p><span><span>I’m obviously overweight but I try to keep it in a good parameter. I’m quite good at the moment. I’ve lost weight – about 16 pounds. I can bend down and put my shoes on easier. It’s very good and I feel so much better.</span></span></p><p>He had revealed previously that he went to a medically supervised health spa in Germany to help himself with his Type 2 diabetes where he was encouraged to <span>cut off sugar</span>. And he did ditch sugary treats. He gave up sweet treats such as sugar and Diet Coke and it helped him get trim and in shape. Christopher Biggins underwent a dramatic weight loss of 16 pounds that had everyone talking.</p><p><span><span>When you’re diagnosed you of course don’t realise that sugar is everywhere. I used to drink fresh orange juice in the morning, which is like drinking two pounds of sugar. Now I drink coconut water, and I don’t get cravings. Now I pick items up in the supermarket and I look how much sugar the food contains. If it contains 54 percent sugar, for example, then I put it back. On a daily basis, I do this now, whereas before I didn’t.</span></span></p><p>He also incorporated light exercise into his weekly routine. Because he loathes the gym, he took to walking daily. And that’s all there is to Christopher Biggins’ weight loss. At least that’s all he has revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0wM6pn56qXZe2qLPIp6pmoJGZerixyKCfrWWcpMC0ecCfq56qXZjCtcDIp55mp5aberTBxpqpaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchristopher-biggins-had-weight-loss-after-cutting-off-sugar.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchristopher-biggins-had-weight-loss-after-cutting-off-sugar.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchristopher-biggins-had-weight-loss-after-cutting-off-sugar.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchristopher-biggins-had-weight-loss-after-cutting-off-sugar.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchristopher-biggins-had-weight-loss-after-cutting-off-sugar.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchristopher-biggins-had-weight-loss-after-cutting-off-sugar.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./comedian-lavell-crawford-weight-loss-update-2022-his-role-as-huell-babineaux-in-better-call-saul-359793-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./comedian-lavell-crawford-weight-loss-update-2022-his-role-as-huell-babineaux-in-better-call-saul-359793-html.html>Comedian Lavell Crawford Weight Loss Update 2022- His Role As Huell Babineaux In Better Call Saul</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christina-ricci-net-worth.html>Christina Ricci Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./christina-ricci-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
