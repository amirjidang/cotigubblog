It's difficult to craft a winning sitcom, but networks, and even streaming services like <a href=#>Netflix</a>, try their hand each year to find the next Seinfeld.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seinfeld was king of the 90s, and <a href=#>the cast still gets paid for reruns</a>. <a href=#>The cast had some tense moments on set</a>, but overall, they were dynamic together. Their chemistry on-screen was outstanding, but they might not have been as close socially as some would think.</p><p>Let's hear what Jason Alexander had to say about his friendship with Jerry Seinfeld away from set.</p><h2 id=were-jason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-close>Were Jason Alexander And Jerry Seinfeld Close?</h2><p>The 1990s was a decade that completely redefined and reshaped television, and this was thanks to its exceptional offerings. The sitcom genre really took a step forward during the decade, and a huge reason why was the outstanding work of a show called Seinfeld.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Technically, the sitcom got its start in the 1980s, but it was during the following decade that it really took off with audiences. Once it got the right formula down, it quickly became the biggest show on television, and it dominated the 1990s with an iron fist.</p><p>Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards were dynamic performers during the show's legendary run. They each brought something unique to the series, but more importantly, they balanced each other out each episode. No matter who the focal point was, you could rest assured that the other performers would give the episode an outstanding balance.</p><p>Clearly, these individuals were the right fit for their characters, and this chemistry translated off-screen for the most part, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Jerry Seinfeld Donate Any Of His Massive Net Worth To Charity?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-39-seinfeld-39-cast-had-great-rapport>The 'Seinfeld' Cast Had Great Rapport</h2><p>For those that have watched Seinfeld, one thing is clear: the lead actors had a great time working together. Yes, things weren't always smooth, but for the most part, these individuals had fun starring in one of the best TV shows ever made.</p><p>Fortunately, a lot has been revealed about their time filming the show. Julia Louis-Dreyfus once shared about what she loved about working on the show with her cast members.</p><p>"(The cast) got a huge kick out of it. Jerry’s laughing the whole time. I mean he can’t act at all and so he’s got a huge smile on his face when anyone is saying anything. And If I looked at him and saw him doing that, then I would (crack) up. Anyway, it took a long time to shoot those things because I was ruining all the takes. And so that was my favorite thing," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Stephen Colbert</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's great to hear that the cast had such an amazing time working with one another, but this does not necessarily mean that they were the best of friends in real life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Did Estelle Harris Make During Her Time On 'Seinfeld'?</a></span></p><h2 id=jason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-were-39-work-friends-39>Jason Alexander And Jerry Seinfeld Were 'Work Friends'</h2><p>As we know, work friends and personal friends are two totally different things, and Seinfeld fans were surprised to learn that Jason Alexander and Jerry Seinfeld, who played best friends on the show, weren't as close off set.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Alexander</a>, "We were never social friends, we were work friends. We had very different lives. But we really hung out with each other at the show. We were workmates. After nine years, when the show ended, we kind of went, ‘Oh, bye, see ya!’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This definitely comes as quite a surprise to fans, given the chemistry that the cast had on screen with one another. This just proves that they were solid actors who were able to bring out the best in one another while the cameras were rolling.</p><p>In truth, it is not uncommon for performers to keep their professional and private lives away from one another.</p><p>Jake Johnson famously talked about not hanging out with his fellow New Girl cast members.</p><p>"I've never hung out with Max Greenfield or Lamorne Morris outside of work. Not once. I've never hung out with Damon Wayans Jr. Mind you, if we are shooting on location then we all go out to eat. We all like each other," he said.</p><p>While it might seem a bit odd, especially with stories of cast members becoming best friends, the truth is that it's a bit different for every performer on every show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Julia Louis-Dreyfus Unintentionally Killed Off A 'Seinfeld' Character</a></span></p><p>Jason Alexander and Jerry Seinfeld might not have been bust buds away from the cameras, but their work as on-screen best friends will forever remain an iconic piece of television history, and that's truly amazing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Real Reason Jason Alexander Threatened To Quit 'Seinfeld'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqufo3qiuMSxmKeclad6orrDZqGeqqKuerSxyKednqSUYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjason-alexander-and-jerry-seinfeld-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-momoa-says-hes-proud-of-zoe-kravitz-after-lisa-bonet-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-momoa-says-hes-proud-of-zoe-kravitz-after-lisa-bonet-split.html>Jason Momoa Says Hes Proud of Zoe Kravitz After Lisa Bonet Split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jason-aldean-pulls-new-album-from-spotify-just-like-taylor-swift-20141011.html>Jason Aldean Pulls New Album From Spotify, Just Like Taylor Swift</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jason-aldean-pulls-new-album-from-spotify-just-like-taylor-swift-20141011.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
