Today, reality TV is a big part of mainstream pop culture and the entertainment industry at large, and while reality shows come in different forms, it goes without saying that some are pretty scripted and others are definitely not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Comedians With Hilarious Instagram Accounts</a></span></p><p>For the more scripted ones, it is not uncommon for actors, singers, and maybe even comedians to make guest appearances or even to appear as a part of the main cast. With comedians, fans can always expect different twists and turns which makes the shows all the more enjoyable for viewers. No doubt, comedians play an important role in modern day reality TV. So who are some of these comics who are not shy to bring their own spin to the reality TV scene? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=jeff-dunham><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jeff Dunham</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through all the seasons of <a href=#>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a>, Caitlyn Jenner was rarely seen palling around with a buddy. That changed, however, in episode 18 of season 8 when Caitlyn started spending a lot of time with comedian Jeff Dunham. The pair's friendship had fans glued to their screens and all thanks to the E! cameras, we never missed a minute of fun.</p><p>For Jenner, having a friend outside of her family was nothing short of amazing, mostly because they share very similar interests. The two were often seen driving old cars and flying drones and doing many more fun activities. Since a large part of Keeping Up With The Kardashians feels very scripted, Jeff sure was able to bring his own twists and humor which fans clearly loved.</p><h2 id=steve-harvey><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Steve Harvey</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In season 15 episode 5 of Family Feud, <a href=#>Steve Harvey</a> handled a contest between the Kardashians and Kanye West's family. The version aired on CBS and was clearly very edited, and therefore very different from the behind the scenes look we saw on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. On KUWTK, fans saw a more chaotic production process mainly caused by the Kardashian-Jenner's inability to decide who would be their fifth player.</p><p>Initially, Mary Jo, the family matriarch, said she was not sure if she could make it to the show, causing Kim to call her friend Jonathan Cheban to come in as the fifth player. Things however took a turn when Mary Jo showed up after Jonathan's arrival. Expectedly, this brought about a debate about who would have to be kicked off the team but to make matters easier, Steve Harvey went against the rules. For the first time in the show's history, Harvey allowed six players on a team. A really nice spin if you ask us!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joel-dommett><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Joel Dommett</span></h2><p>Comedian and presenter, Joel Dommett is the anchor of the popular reality show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Masked Singer UK</a>.

He also did the same exact thing on every other reality shows he appeared in or hosted.</p><h2 id=kevin-hart><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kevin Hart</span></h2><p>American comedian and actor, <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a> was cast as a guest star on the business reality TV show called Shark Tank which features entrepreneurs from various fields attempting to secure finance investments for their business ideas. On the show, Kevin, of course, incorporated his comedic personality that viewers clearly enjoyed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olga-koch><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Olga Koch</span></h2><p>UK comedy fans will recognize Olga Koch.

Her clever quips and banter about contestants are always spot on and have remained one of the biggest highlights of the show. Michelle is no doubt one of the best in the game, and she's brought a brand new style of hosting to the world of reality TV.</p><h2 id=chris-rock><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Chris Rock</span></h2><p>In the second season of Real Husbands of Hollywood, Chris Rock appeared, replacing singer-songwriter Robin Thicke. The show is a fully scripted parody of reality TV shows, and it plays on the competitive relationship between all of the guys in the cast. A few episode saw Rock have a face-off with star Kevin Hart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sara-pascoe><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sara Pascoe</span></h2><p>The English comedian has appeared on reality television shows such as QI and Taskmaster.
