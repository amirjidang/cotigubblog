What started as a reality show on E! Network about an odd-ball famous family, the Kardashians have made a name for themselves in all media outlets. Their show is still going strong after eight seasons and now the family is even more in the spotlight now that <a href=#>Bruce Jenner</a> has become Caitlyn. It seems that the daily news always has some kind of item about one of the Kardashians, whether it is <a href=#>Kim</a> and <a href=#>Kanye</a>'s marital adventures, <a href=#>Kris</a> dishing about her eccentric brood, or <a href=#>Kendall</a> strutting her stuff on the runway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can't deny it: the Kardashians are here to stay. We love them or love to hate them, but we pay attention to them more often than not. They intrigue us and they annoy us and they provide a nice escape when we are sick and tired of our ho-hum lives. While they may be amusing a times, there are other moments when they are downright pests. Here is our list of 10 of the most annoying Kardashian moments. We have outlined ten things that most needle us about this family that is famous for being famous.</p><h2 id=10-when-they-flaunt-their-money><strong>10. When They Flaunt Their Money</strong></h2><p>Yes, we get it. You are rich and powerful, so good for you. The Kardashians just love to show the rest of the world that they are rich and famous for doing just about nothing. So much for a rags-to-riches story. It looks like now we all have to look at Instagram and Twitter accounts that are awash with glittering photos and snapshots of the Kardashian lifestyle. Just when we thought if we simply did not watch their television series, we would be safe! Nope. Now it seems that everywhere we look we see them touting their wealth: “Running out of room in the icebox” for all my bling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-when-they-pretend-their-higher-than-c-listers><strong>9. When They Pretend Their Higher Than C-Listers</strong></h2><p>When did the Kardashians become A-list celebs? The last time we checked, they were still on the lower rung of celebrity status, at least in the classy sense of the term. Whereas other celebrities have made a name for themselves by being stellar actors and actresses, singers, or musicians, the Kardashian clan is a family that has clinched their claim to fame by being rich and obnoxious. Sure, it may be funny to watch their shenanigans on television, but the more we watch, the more we enable their conceit! The sad truth is that we are partly to blame for their success, riches and fame.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-when-we-realize-they-are-raising-mini-kardashians><strong>8. When We Realize They Are Raising Mini-Kardashians</strong></h2><p>It is bad enough that there are so many of them already...but they are now raising little Kardashians of their own! We already have Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe Kardashian; then Kendall and Kylie Jenner; plus the parents Kris and Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner. Kourtney has kids, and Kim has a little one, so it is only a matter of time before we have a whole new generation of self-righteous, egoistic little imps running around. We have seen it with Kendall and Kylie, who are morphing into their older sisters. More on them later though. Hopefully the new additions to the Kardashian family get a positive and wholesome upbringing. Yeah, right.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-when-they-post-so-many-selfies><strong>7. When They Post So Many Selfies</strong></h2><p>And we mean so many selfies. We could fill a coffee table book with all of these snapshots. From too many cleavage pics to count, to bathing suit photos, and vacation snapshots, we are so sick and tired of it. These photographs are beyond annoying. We do not need to see Kim after her shower, Kourtney trying to breast-feed, or Khloe posing with her boy-toy. We have received an onslaught of Kendall's modeling selfies and Kylie's trashier self-centered photos. Even Kris Jenner is not immune to the selfie craze, and we certainly will never be the same after seeing her in a bikini.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-when-kanye-tags-along><strong>6. When Kanye Tags Along</strong></h2><p>What happens when you mix the Kardashians with <a href=#>Kanye West</a>? Well, apparently you get Kimye and more recently, North West. This is perhaps the most annoying celebrity marriage we can think of. Kanye is already known for being a grade-A jerk and now he is running around with Kim Kardashian, who already considers herself to be the best thing since sliced bread. Not that we are hostile...just considering how many times Kanye has put his foot in his mouth, we are only bound to hear more from him now that he is married to Kim. We are hoping that he will prove himself to be an adequate father and maybe having a baby will help him to simmer down a bit.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-when-they-lose-perspective><strong>5. When They Lose Perspective</strong></h2><p>Yes, the Kardashians are sometimes rather good at losing focus and placing all the importance of the world on themselves. At times they need to be reminded by Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner to stop taking photos of themselves, or they need a total reality check (like, people are dying while they complain about a guy leaving the seat up.) They shed tears over the stupidest things sometimes that it is just beyond annoying. We want to cringe when Kim sobs over nothing or Kylie goes into a hissy fit for not getting her way. You have a reality show centered around your life; we think you will be just fine, girls!</p><p></p><h2 id=4-when-they-try-to-be-likable><strong>4. When They Try To Be Likable</strong></h2><p>Khloe Kardashian tried to appeal to the public by ditching her sisters and hosting The X Factor alongside <a href=#>Mario Lopez</a>. Well, she did not do such a hot job and she never returned for a second season on the hit show. That is too bad...at least she was trying to be more likable. Kendall also proclaimed her un-Kardashian-ness by appearing on a magazine cover that stated she was Kendall Jenner, not Kardashian. Be that as it may, the whole clan is still annoying; it is kind of like their shenanigans follow them wherever they go. Will it ever be possible for us to be able to fully tolerate these people?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-when-they-think-they-could-run-the-country><strong>3. When They Think They Could Run The Country</strong></h2><p>You may not believe this, but Kim once stated that maybe she would run for the mayor of Glendale. Yup, and if you would be frightened by a Kim for Mayor button or banner, you are not alone! We would be terrified to have Kim Kardashian in charge of any public area. What would be first on her agenda? Passing a law that requires all Glendale residents to participate in “selfie Sunday?” Banning local discount retailers? Making one of Kanye's raps the new town anthem? Let's just hope that Kim was not serious when she said she would run “probably in five years or so.”</p><p></p><h2 id=2-when-they-permeate-the-media><strong>2. When They Permeate The Media</strong></h2><p>The Kardashians are everywhere! We can't escape them! Even we cut our cable, put restrictions on our Internet surfing, and try to live under a rock, odds are that we will find out something about the Kardashians. Keeping Up With the Kardashians is turning into an actual thing! We can barely catch our breath as we try to keep track of this family. Sometimes they are given more importance than actual global events. Take the Today show's interview with Kris Jenner, which was aired in place of a 9/11 memorial service. So not cool, NBC. We thought we could be safe from the Kardashians by watching a news station. Wrong again!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-when-we-realize-that-kendall-and-kylie-are-the-next-wave><strong>1. When We Realize That Kendall And Kylie Are The Next Wave</strong></h2><p>Unless you have been living the hermit lifestyle lately you know that Kendall and Kylie have been taking the media by storm. Whether it is news about Kylie's trip to the grocery store or Kendall's latest photo shoot (she is now working as a model), there is tons of coverage on the young women. They are finishing up their teenage years and are sure to usher in the next wave of Kardashian-addicts. Let's face it: we love them, we hate them, and we are obsessed. As long as we continue to talk about the Kardashians and pay attention to their antics, they will not be going away any time soon!</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>lifestyle.yahoo.com</a>, <a href=#>buzzfeed.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ks27Ax55kpqejqXqius2osKKml2LBqbXNoKpmmZKkwrV506GcZqORp7Giv8eimKerXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-of-the-most-annoying-things-about-the-kardashians.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-of-the-most-annoying-things-about-the-kardashians.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-of-the-most-annoying-things-about-the-kardashians.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-of-the-most-annoying-things-about-the-kardashians.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-of-the-most-annoying-things-about-the-kardashians.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-of-the-most-annoying-things-about-the-kardashians.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./12-adult-jokes-you-missed-in-warner-brothers-cartoons.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./12-adult-jokes-you-missed-in-warner-brothers-cartoons.html>12 Adult Jokes You Missed in Warner Brothers Cartoons</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./yung-lean-net-worth.html>Yung Lean Net Worth How Much is Lean Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./yung-lean-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
