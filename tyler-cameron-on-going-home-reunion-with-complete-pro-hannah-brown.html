<time>07 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Tyler Cameron</strong></a> fought hard to get his ex and former Bachelorette<a href=#><strong> Hannah Brown</strong></a> to join him on an episode of <i>Going Home With Tyler Cameron.</i></p><p class=p1>“She was great and I really had a call and a favor for her,” Tyler, 31, exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>ahead of the season 1 premiere of <i>Going Home</i>. “I really needed her to do this for me because my designer <strong>Jess [Quintero]</strong> was too busy. She’s like, ‘Ty, I can’t do this anymore.’ I go, ‘Jess, this is my dream <a href=#>home to renovate</a>. We have to find a way to do this.’”</p><p class=p1>Tyler, a licensed contractor before appearing on reality TV, was admittedly “freaking out” that his design partner was unable to help him with the project.</p><p class=p1>“I’m like, ‘Who are we going to design this house with?’ And I remember <strong>Karen</strong> [the client], she loves <a href=#><i>The</i> <i>Bachelorette</i></a>. That’s how she found me [and] that’s how she found Hannah,” he explained. “She loves Hannah. I was like, ‘I bet you I can make this go really well if I get Hannah involved.’ So I had to kind of do my pleading with Hannah.”</p><p class=p1>After Tyler’s pleas to Hannah, 29, were “finally” answered, she traveled to Florida to film the episode.</p><p class=p1>“She came down and she was a rock star,” Tyler gushed to <i>Us,</i> joking that “of course” he had a little PTSD being<a href=#> in front of cameras with Hannah</a> again. “She had a beautiful design. She worked her butt off and she was a complete pro and just so great to work with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Tyler-Cameron-Had-to-Call-in-a-Favor-to-Get-Hannah-Brown-to-Join-Him-on-Going-Home-Renovation.jpg><p class=p1>Tyler rose to fame as one of interior designer Hannah’s <a href=#>contestants on season 15</a> of <i>The Bachelorette</i>, where she ultimately broke up with him during the finale in favor of her now-ex<strong> Jed Wyatt</strong>. Hannah and Jed, 27, called it quits shortly after the show aired and she has since moved on with fiancé <strong>Adam Woolard</strong>.</p><p class=p1>After Hannah agreed to film <i>Going Home</i>, she and Tyler had a few hurdles to overcome.</p><p class=p1>“I think we had to iron some things out, but I thought we worked out honestly better than expected,” Tyler quipped. “I was curious to see how it was going to be, but she’s such a trooper and she did such a great job.”</p><p class=p1>On <i>Going Home</i>, Tyler launches his own construction and home renovation business called Image One in Jupiter, Florida, where he grew up. While tackling a variety of reno projects, Tyler joins forces with Jess and house-flipping expert <strong>Robb Ritch</strong>.</p><p class=p1>“They’re great to work with,” he told <i>Us</i>. “Jessica is a little firecracker [and] Rob is super woody, always fun to work with, but Rob knows so much about the industry. Jess has got fun, design, taste and flavor, and I think you put all three of us together; you kind of get a crazy wild bunch.”</p><p class=p1>Tyler was also able to enlist his father, <strong>Jeff</strong>, and his brothers, <strong>Ryan</strong> and <strong>Austin</strong>, to join the fun. (Tyler, Ryan and Austin’s mother, <strong>Andrea</strong>, <a href=#>died in 2020</a>.)</p><p class=p1>“Pops will be [on the show],” the Bachelor Nation alum teased. “Pops will tell you like, ‘Oh, I hate the cameras. I don’t want to do this.’ You couldn’t get that guy off the camera. He wanted to find a way to make a cameo every way he could. … He loves the cameras more than any one of us [and] Ryan, he’s kind of the same way.”</p><p class=p1>Tyler added,&nbsp; “I think Austin’s the only one [who] could probably do without the cameras. He’s more shy, more mild, but Pops and my brother Ryan, they loved it.”</p><p class=p1>Tyler’s <a href=#>rumored girlfriend</a>, <strong>Tate Madden</strong>, also pops up in the background of the show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“She’s on there. She came and shot some photography for us,” Tyler coyly added. “She can do it all. She’s very well-rounded. Great at all aspects of renovation, design and all that stuff.”</p><p class=p1><i>Going Home With Tyler Cameron </i>is currently streaming on Prime Video.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Sarah Hearon</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuypJWneqStzJ6pqKZdpLtus86ipaBlmKS6pnnRnqynoZ%2Bjeri106FknKedpbmmwMRmp6unXZ2ur7rAoWSbqp%2Bsu3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftyler-cameron-on-going-home-reunion-with-complete-pro-hannah-brown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftyler-cameron-on-going-home-reunion-with-complete-pro-hannah-brown.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftyler-cameron-on-going-home-reunion-with-complete-pro-hannah-brown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftyler-cameron-on-going-home-reunion-with-complete-pro-hannah-brown.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftyler-cameron-on-going-home-reunion-with-complete-pro-hannah-brown.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-cameron-on-going-home-reunion-with-complete-pro-hannah-brown.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vanessa-williams.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vanessa-williams.html>Vanessa Williams News - Us Weekly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tim-anderson-who-is-wife-bria-anderson-children-paxton-anderson-and-peyton-anderson-638634-html.html>Tim Anderson: Who is wife Bria Anderson, children Paxton Anderson and Peyton Anderson?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tim-anderson-who-is-wife-bria-anderson-children-paxton-anderson-and-peyton-anderson-638634-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
