Take <strong>Macklemore</strong> and his classic with Ryan Lewis, "<strong>Thrift Shop</strong>," for instance. The lyrics to that aren't ironic, he really loves the experience. And isn't that the mark of a&nbsp;true fashion icon: someone who can rock an incredible look using only inexpensive and secondhand threads? We think so. These are some of the most fabulous A-listers, musicians, and other celebs who love a good deal and aren't above shopping at thrift stores (and we love them for it!).</p><h2 id=macklemore><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Macklemore</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only one celebrity on this list loves thrift stores enough to make a song about them. Macklemore's "Thrift Shop" exploded onto the airwaves in 2012 and you couldn't go anywhere without hearing it.&nbsp;Lyrics like&nbsp;"I'm gonna pop some tags, only got 20 dollars in my pocket" speak to exactly what most thrifters love about thrift stores: the feeling of being able to <a href=#>shop like a king</a>, not deny yourself any purchase. $20 in a thrift store goes a long way!</p><h2 id=zooey-deschanel><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Zooey Deschanel</span></h2><p>Of course queen of cool Zooey Deschanel shops at thrift stores. She seems like the kind of girl who, if you tell her you love her shoes, her response is gonna be, "Oh, this little vintage thrift store in Rio," or some other completely random and inaccessible place. She has thrift shopping to thank for her famously cool and quirky style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-roberts><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Julia Roberts</span></h2><p>Even A-listers are doing it! Julia Roberts is known to frequent thrift stores <a href=#>with her kids</a> near their ranch in New Mexico. She explains that she especially loves buying kids' clothes at secondhand stores because of how quickly kids grow out of them or their tastes change. One source close to Julia said, "She'll go anywhere in search of a great deal. She's been known to travel all the way to Tucson for a weekend of shopping at secondhand stores."</p><h2 id=janelle-monae><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Janelle Monae</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Okay, this one really takes the cake. Janelle Monae is a style icon and she's one of those people who can rock absolutely anything and make it look like the coolest piece on earth, so we should have known she was a thrifter. About her thrifting habit, she says, "I like one-of-a-kind pieces. I don't like everybody walking around in stuff that I have on."</p><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sarah Jessica Parker</span></h2><p>If anyone knows fashion, it's Sarah Jessica Parker, who has worn some of the most gorgeous and high-end outfits we've ever seen on TV. And yep, you guessed it, she's a thrifter. She credits the&nbsp;film The True Cost with her thrift store awakening. The documentary explores the labor conditions&nbsp;created by the fast fashion industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Hereâ€™s Why Paris Hilton Is Wearing Thrift Clothing</a></span></p><h2 id=lorde><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lorde</span></h2><p>Given Lorde's first single "Royals," it should come as no surprise that she can clean up in a thrift shop. She subverts&nbsp;the consumerist culture in popular music, explaining her and her friends' more down-to-earth ideology: "That kind of luxe just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz." Any thrifter knows there's no buzz like the buzz a great deal can give you!</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Drew Barrymore</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Drew Barrymore has been earning movie star money since she was in diapers, but that doesn't mean she's only shopping on 5th Avenue. The star has been known to frequent thrift stores and was <a href=#>seen last summer</a> with her husband and their two kids in a thrift shop on Nantucket, where they spent the season. The store owner marveled at how warm and friendly she was.</p><h2 id=helen-mirren><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Helen Mirren</span></h2><p>Helen Mirren is a self-described "get-a-dress-at-the-thrift-shop-but-open-a-bottle-of-champagne kind of person." She continues, "You can spend a dollar on a jacket in a thrift store. And you can spend a thousand dollars on a jacket in a shop. And if you saw those two jackets walking down the street, you probably wouldn't know which was which."&nbsp;And if Helen Mirren says it, you know it's true!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>'Marie Kondo Effect' Is Giving Thrift Stores Booming Business</a></span></p><h2 id=jada-pinkett-smith><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jada Pinkett Smith</span></h2><p>Jada Pinkett Smith is a longtime thrifter and has passed the hobby on to her kids. "Thrifting, repairing and patching clothing is the future," says Jaden Smith. "I'm starting to see more statistics on fashion...and I like that." Jada's $20 million net worth probably goes a long way in a thrift store!</p><h2 id=eva-mendes><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Eva Mendes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eva Mendes has taken thrifting to a whole new level: she once wore a $6 Goodwill dress to a red carpet event! <a href=#>She remembers</a> that it was her first red carpet and she had also done her own hair and makeup to save on costs. "Viva thrift shops!" she wrote.
