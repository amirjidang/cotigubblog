Despite the big box office performance from World War Z, a sequel for the film was never produced. That is probably due to all the issues that threatened the World War Z from pre-production right through to filming and post-production.</p><p>Loosely based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Max Brooks, Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a UN investigator who finds himself trying to protect his family while also trying to find a cure for the disease.</p><p>In the following, we take a look at what happened with production of World War Z and why the film was delayed and had to reshoot the entire ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=world-war-z-was-plagued-with-budget-and-production-issues>World War Z Was Plagued With Budget And Production Issues</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/world-war-z.jpg><h3 id=director-vs-screenwriter>Director Vs Screenwriter</h3><p>After Brad Pitt's Plan B production company won the rights to Brook's novel, Michael Straczynski (Thor and Underworld: Awakening) was snapped up to write the script for World War Z. When the script was leaked online in 2008, it was met with praise. The writing was different from the book, where the zombie apocalypse was depicted through fictional newspaper articles and interviews.</p><p>Marc Foster (Quantum of Solace) signed on as a director on Pitt's recommendation, which ultimately led to the production's issues.<strong> Forster and Straczynski clashed immediately</strong>, as both had different ideas on how Brooks' novel should be adapted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Straczynski wanted the script to maintain the cerebral source material, while Forster wanted a more action-packed movie.</strong></p><p>Even after a rewrite, the pair could not agree. Ultimately, the screenwriter and World War Z parted ways, and Matthew Michael Carnahan was brought in to overhaul the script.</p><p><strong>Many cite the hiring of Marc Forster as one of the issues with the production of World War Z.</strong> His only previous venture into action blockbusters was <a href=# rel=nofollow>the poorly received Quantum of Solace</a>. For this reason, Simon Crane, the second-unit director who helped on Brad Pitt’s 2005 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith was brought in.</p><p>“The director was not empowered. There was nobody that steered the ship. … When you get [a director] who can’t do it all … you get a struggle as to whose is the singular voice.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This wasn't the first time Marc Foster ran into issues while directing a movie. On the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bond sequel he made in 2008, on-set issues soon hit</a>. "On 'Quantum' we were f*****," Daniel Craig told Time Out London. "We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brad-pitt-johnny-depp.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Brad Pitt Is Rumored To Have Hired Johnny Depp's Crisis Team After His Children Ruined His Image">Brad Pitt Is Rumored To Have Hired Johnny Depp's Crisis Team After His Children Ruined His Image</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Brad Pitt may have hired a PR crisis team to help restore his image — the same team that helped Johnny Depp avoid being canceled.</p><h3 id=last-minute-production-changes>Last Minute Production Changes</h3><p>Three weeks before shooting of World War Z was expected to start in June 2011, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marc Forster was still making decisions</a> about the look of the zombies and how they would move on-screen.

It has been reported that line producer Colin Wilson (Avatar) and Oscar-winning effects man John Nelson (Gladiator) were hired and replaced. Cinematographer Robert Richardson, who has won three Oscars over his career, is said to have asked to leave the production multiple times.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Brad Pitt's Highest Movie Salaries Explain His Net Worth And Outlandish Lifestyle</a></span></p><h3 id=budget-issues>Budget Issues</h3><p>World War Z filming began in mid-2011 with an expected budget of over $125 million, but this soon ballooned.

This didn't go to plan and <strong>Brad Pitt and the production team nearly faced criminal charges.</strong></p><p>On the morning of October 10, 2011, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a Hungarian SWAT team raided the warehouse where the crew of World War Z</a> had stored weapons to be used in filming, seizing 85 military-style assault rifles, handguns, and grenades.</p><p>According to reports at the time, <strong>the import papers claimed that the guns had been disabled when they were actually still fully functional. </strong>This was illegal in Hungary, causing Brad Pitt and the production company to be criminally investigated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The arsenal was eventually returned to Pitt's production company and the charges were dropped on a technicality. With the movie already behind schedule and over budget, Pitt was said to be livid at this error.

World War Z is a giant summer movie and we are confident it will be a global hit when it’s released June 2013.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The World War Z ending sees Pitt's Gerry in a World Health Organization building with a small group of survivors. He needs to get to the center of the buildings and past all the infected zombies. Gerry infects himself with the pathogen, so he can walk past the living dead unharmed. The film ends with an uplifting montage of humanity fighting back and surviving. This is very different from the depressing original ending.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/denzel-washington-brad-pitt.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Brad Pitt Only Starred In This $327 Million Hit Film Because Denzel Washington Turned It Down">Brad Pitt Only Starred In This $327 Million Hit Film Because Denzel Washington Turned It Down</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Denzel Washington said no to a project, which led to Brad Pitt replacing him — and creating a box office hit.</p><p>In the originally ending, a time jump would show Gerry still fighting in Russia months ahead. They learn that zombies move slower in the cold, giving humans the upper hand. It's revealed he hasn't spoken to his family, and his wife has started a relationship with Matthew Fox's paratrooper.</p><p>Those who saw the early cut of World War Z, including Brad Pitt and Paramount, described the ending as "abrupt and incoherent." To fix the ending, Paramount hired <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Damon Lindelof to rewrite the script</a> and spent millions of dollars refilling the last 40 minutes of the zombie blockbuster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUYr2qwNNmn6KfmJrAtXnGq6asq5mjtG65zq%2BgnmWenrSpwMyaqZ5lkpq1qrrDZquhnV2osKa6xKxksKeimXq4rdFmsWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrad-pitt-highest-grossing-movie-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-word-war-z.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrad-pitt-highest-grossing-movie-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-word-war-z.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrad-pitt-highest-grossing-movie-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-word-war-z.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrad-pitt-highest-grossing-movie-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-word-war-z.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrad-pitt-highest-grossing-movie-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-word-war-z.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrad-pitt-highest-grossing-movie-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-word-war-z.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-on-britney-spears-payroll.html>Britney Spears Is Thrilled With Her New Staff After Cutting Out Employees</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./apolla-performance-compression-socks-shark-tank.html>Apolla Performance Compression Socks Shark Tank Update</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./apolla-performance-compression-socks-shark-tank.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
