"Going to religion doesn’t make you a good person," another said.</p><p>One comment voiced: "I hope people don’t forget how crude he has been for the past 10 years. Literally, this is something a religion can’t fix. Some people are just awful to their core. He’s just a total freak with angry issues."</p><p>Some did show support for the actor's new change. "He’s obviously been troubled for a very long time, and if faith genuinely helps him, I’m all for it. I think it’s red flag behavior, though, that instead of just being devout, he is striving for a position of power," the fan wrote.</p><p>However, LaBeouf has been interested in Christianity for a very long time.

While Olivia Wilde reportedly fired Shia LaBeouf from the film Don't Worry Darling for being unruly, Shia begs to differ. <a href=#>La Beouf claimed there were scheduling conflicts with the cast</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only that, LaBeouf is known to immerse himself in method acting, which often leads to friction with his co-stars. His firing from the stage play is a clear example. <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf and Alec Baldwin got off on the wrong foot while working on the Broadway play Orphans</a>, and things got so uncomfortable that one actor had to go. Shia LaBeouf was booted.</p><p>The misdemeanors, public intoxication, aggressive behavior, multiple arrests, assault charges, lawsuits, and other controversies that have trailed the actor have accumulated to form an unsavory reputation for the actor. And with the assault charges FKA Twigs filed against him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia LaBeouf's career has seemed to have been put on the back burner</a>.</p><p>However, Shia LaBeouf is still active as an actor. He gets roles in movies, but not likely to be seen in a blockbuster like Transformers or Indiana Jones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And he seems to be on a path to redemption for himself. First taking up religion, then finding solace with his family. LaBeouf’s troubled lifestyle and violent outbursts have been the actor's major stumbles in his career. However, the Disturbia actor credits his wife, Mia Goth, and daughter for changing him.</p><p><a href=#>Shia LaBeouf claims his daughter makes him at peace and feels calm</a> because he wants to be a good father — a stark contrast to <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf's complicated relationship with his father</a>.</p><p>From being the awkward teen star in the Disney sitcom Even Stevens to leading one of the biggest trilogies in Hollywood, to his chaotic life on and off camera to his seemingly quiet life, Shia LaBeouf has experienced it all.</p><p>With the ups and downs of his career, people wonder what happened to Shia LaBeouf. He has taken up Christianity and wants to become a deacon sometime in the future. However, fans are hoping it is not another ruse of the actor's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8br%2FHophmpJGXsrDBxWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./forget-cars-constance-nunes-is-more-into-plastic-surgery.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./forget-cars-constance-nunes-is-more-into-plastic-surgery.html>Forget Cars, Constance Nunes Is More Into Plastic Surgery</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./famous-celebrities-that-are-christian.html>Famous Celebrities That Are Christian</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./famous-celebrities-that-are-christian.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
