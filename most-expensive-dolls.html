However, some dolls are crafted just as decoratives. Dolls have existed with humans for a long time now. The earliest dolls date back to 21st Century BC, when they were made from clay and stone. With its rich architecture and history, even a not-so-special doll can be lucrative. The rarity of a doll is determined by several factors - the year of production, units sold, availability, and <a href=#>even the controversy behind it</a>.</p><p>Dolls, from being vintage plush toys to exhibiting miniature jewelry, have a rich history. Over the years, Collectibles have become a strong growth area since people are always keen to add rare and expensive toys to their collection. Here’s a glimpse at some of the most expensive dolls in the world.</p><h2 id=mego-elastic-batman---15-000>Mego Elastic Batman - $15,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mego created a series of Elastic superhero figures in 1979. However, the company was sued by Kenner because the Batman was too similar to their product lineup ‘Stretch Armstrong.' Only two of these Elastic Batman dolls exist, making them <a href=#>one of the rarest toys in the world</a>. One of these dolls fetched over $15,000 at an auction in 2006.</p><h2 id=vinyl-cape-jawa---18-000>Vinyl Cape Jawa - $18,000</h2><p>Released as a part of the original Star Wars figurines in 1978, Kenner sold the Jawas with a vinyl cape for a few months. Being the smallest figure in the lineup, fans felt compelled to point out that cheap vinyl and size were not worth the price of $1.99. The cape then changed to cloth, and this made the vinyl cape rare. It was then sold off at over $18,000 at the Vectis Auction.</p><h2 id=life-sized-megumi-kato---19-600>Life-Sized Megumi Kato - $19,600</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A part of the most exclusive <a href=#>anime collection</a>, only ten of the life-sized Megumi Kato dolls were ever produced. Over five feet tall, Megumi Kato is from a manga and anime called How To Raise A Boring Girlfriend. Ten lucky applicants were selected to purchase and receive these anime figurines through a draw.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Both Seasons Of Harley Quinn's Animated Show Are Coming To HBO Max</a></span></p><h2 id=steiff-dicky-bear---53-803>Steiff Dicky Bear - $53,803</h2><p>Steiff Dicky Bear was low priced during the Great Depression in the 1930s to suit the needs of the financial crisis. The Dicky Bear was five-jointed with golden mohair, brown-black eyes, and a black stitched nose. With a button on its rear and a squeaker on the side, the bear remains a rare find today. In the 2000s, one of the Dicky Bears was sold for $53,803 at a Christie’s Auction.</p><h2 id=steiff-titanic-mourning-bear---136-000>Steiff Titanic Mourning Bear - $136,000</h2><p>Only 600 of these units were produced in five different sizes. The all-black mourning bear was a commemoration of the RMS Titanic that sank in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1912</a>. Sold exclusively in the English Market, the black bears sold out overnight. <a href=#>At a Christie’s auction,</a> one of these 19-inch bears with a Steiff tag was sold for $136,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Original G.I Joe - $200,000</p><p>A whopping $200,000 was spent by businessman Stephan Geppi to buy a handmade 11.5-inch 1963 prototype G.I Joe toy soldier figure. Made by the creator of the G.I. Joe action figures, Donald Levine, the prototype was the model based on which all the action figures were produced from 1964, making it a valuable find.</p><h2 id=stefano-canturi-barbie--302-500>Stefano Canturi Barbie- $302,500</h2><p>Australian designer Stefano Canturi spent six months creating the most expensive Barbie to date. The doll adorned a diamond cubism necklace, which circled an Australian Argyle pink diamond weighing a pound. The <a href=#>Barbie doll</a> was auctioned off for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, where it raised<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $302,500</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steiff-louis-vuitton-teddy-bear---2-1-million>Steiff Louis Vuitton Teddy Bear - $2.1 million</h2><p>Named the world’s most expensive teddy bear, Steiff collaborated with Louis Vuitton to create a museum-worthy doll. The bear is accessorized with a miniature Louis Vuitton suitcase, trench coat, and a beret. It was auctioned off at a Monaco Charity to Jessie Kim for $2.1 million. The bear is now displayed at the Teddy Bear Museum in Jeju, South Korea.</p><h2 id=madame-alexander-eloise--5-million>Madame Alexander Eloise- $5 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Named after its moniker Madame Alexander, only five of these handmade dolls exist in the world. With a $5 million price tag, it is one of the most antique collectibles. The dolls came with inscribed nine-carat diamonds, Oscar de la Renta fur, Katherine Baumann Accessories, and <a href=#>clothes by Dior</a>. To add to the grandiose, the dolls have an individual pet dog too.</p><h2 id=l-oiseleur-the-bird-trainer---6-25-million>L'Oiseleur (The Bird Trainer) - $6.25 million</h2><p>A doll that is also a gadget, the Bird Trainer is constructed with over 2,340 pieces of metal parts. Designed by fourteen craftsmen, led by French automata expert Christian Bailey, it took over 15,000 hours to complete this masterpiece. With a four-foot height, the doll can play the flute, dart its eyes around, and the birds can sing along and move after being wound by a golden key. The doll purely works on springs and gears, without using even a watt of electricity, and costs $6.25 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The definition of a doll ranges from an action to a plastic figure, from a stuffed bear to a handmade automaton; however, what remains constant is the rarity of these figurines. Over the years, dolls have become not only popular playthings but also rare collectibles. They can <a href=#>cost up to millions of dollars</a>, but their actual value remains priceless.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The World's Seven Most Expensive Pizzas</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gamer</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sora News 24</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steiff Bears London</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yoqq1lla29prrSoq2eZZSkua2%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmost-expensive-dolls.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmost-expensive-dolls.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmost-expensive-dolls.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmost-expensive-dolls.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmost-expensive-dolls.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmost-expensive-dolls.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./top-10-greatest-mlb-teams-in-new-york-history.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./top-10-greatest-mlb-teams-in-new-york-history.html>Top 10 Greatest MLB Teams in New York History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-net-worth-of-the-cast-of-outer-range-ranked.html>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of 'Outer Range', Ranked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-net-worth-of-the-cast-of-outer-range-ranked.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
