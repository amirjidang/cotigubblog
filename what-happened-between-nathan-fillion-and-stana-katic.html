The show aired for an impressive eight seasons from 2009 until 2016 and was considered a success due to its comforting formula and great relationships between the characters.</p><p>Despite the show doing so well, it appears as if its actors didn't have as great a rapport in real life!

This is big news, since Fillion played the author Richard Castle and Katic played Kate Beckett, a detective who became his love interest, meaning the two worked quite closely together!</p><p>According to Us Weekly though, a source explained, <strong>“Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion completely despise each other. They will not speak when they are offset, and this has been going on for seasons now.”</strong> Yikes!</p><p>A source said that Katic would cry when she was in her dressing room.

Shortly afterwards, the show got canceled.</p><p>Katic explained to Entertainment Weekly, "I’m actually still not clear on the thought process behind the way that it went down. It hurt, and it was a harsh ending, but now, nearly two years later…I met so many beautiful people on that project," she said.</p><p>Katic also spoke to Daily Mail about how she felt about being fired from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Castle</a>, and even years later she "was confused by the entire experience" and quite "hurt" by the abrupt ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But look, time has passed and I am so thankful to have been a part of that project, for it to have affected as many people as it did."</p><p>Even though people say that the co-stars didn't get along, <strong>Fillion tweeted after Katic was fired</strong>, saying:</p><p>"Castle has been one of the greatest joys of my creative life ...

Though they do not interact, that does not mean there is a lot of bad blood between them. Their distance could simply be caused by the different routes they have taken in life.</p><p>Fillion has continued to focus on his career, acting in many different roles and genres. His most recent <a href=#>leading role was in the television series </a><a href=#>The Rookie</a>, and he's also appeared in other TV roles like Bupkis and Monster's At Work. <a href=#>It's even reportedly difficult for him to move on from that Castle drama</a>, though, as it's all anyone ever talks about. However, the actor continues to remain tight-lipped about the drama, especially with his former co-star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katic, on the other hand, appears to be spending a lot of time with her family. She married her husband Kris Brkljac in 2015, and recently they had their first child in 2022. She's still active in the entertainment industry, with one of her most recent projects to debut in early 2024 after she lent her voice to Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths - Part One. It appears she, too, is trying to move on from the Castle drama, as she also rarely speaks about her former gig.</p><ul></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmppGptaK6jJ%2BgpaSZpLturc2dZKyskaOubrfAraCcZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-nathan-fillion-and-stana-katic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-nathan-fillion-and-stana-katic.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-nathan-fillion-and-stana-katic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-nathan-fillion-and-stana-katic.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-nathan-fillion-and-stana-katic.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-nathan-fillion-and-stana-katic.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-bts-jungkook-10-lesser-known-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-bts-jungkook-10-lesser-known-facts.html>Who Is BTS' Jungkook? 10 Lesser-Known Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-tania-raymonde-after-her-brief-big-bang-theory-cameo.html>What Happened To Tania Raymonde After Her Brief Big Bang Theory Cameo?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-tania-raymonde-after-her-brief-big-bang-theory-cameo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
