Well, you might be surprised to hear that she does. Or, you may not be surprised at all. The ninety-five-year-old monarch is extremely fond of getting comfortable on the couch and settling in for an evening of quality TV entertainment. This love of television is certainly not a new thing: if you've ever seen The Crown, you'll know that the Queen has either been watching TV screens or appearing on them since they first appeared in the early '50s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To The Queen Rejecting An 'Oldie Award' Because She Still Feels Young</a></span></p><p>The Queen reportedly likes to watch late at night, after her duties have been done for the day, and views so much television that it has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recently left her 'knackered' from balancing both busy days and late nights.</a> Television is also reportedly a great comfort to the monarch since the death of her late husband, <strong>Prince Philip</strong>. So what sort of shows does the royal like to watch? And does she have any favorites? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=the-queen-enjoys-watching-netflix-39-s-39-the-crown-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Queen Enjoys Watching Netflix's 'The Crown'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If somebody made a multi-million dollar TV show exploring your life and that of your close family in minute detail, you may be forgiven for turning the channel over if it ever came on the TV. But the Queen is not so shy about watching a fictional interpretion of her life on screen, warts and all. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is "reasonably entertained" watching </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Crown </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a senior courtier</a>. She is fond of the storylines, but does find them to be a unrealistic at times, and of course rather far from her recollection of events. Still, she does enjoy watching the royal drama - though how much she has seen, and which seasons, we cannot say.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Queen Fully Trusts Her Granddaughter-In-Law Kate Middleton To Lead The Royal Monarch</a></span></p><h2 id=she-also-enjoys-quiz-shows><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Also Enjoys Quiz Shows</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Queen really is just like us. When she decides to put her feet up in the late afternoon and enjoy some tea and biscuits, she switches on the TV set and settles in to enjoy some quality game shows. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes, it turns out one of her favourite quiz programmes is a UK show called Pointless </a>- in which contestants compete to give the least common answers from a set topic. For example, if asked to give a capital city beginning with 'P', a contestant must give the least memorable answer â€“ so 'Paris' would earn more points than 'Pyongyang', but the goal is to give an answer with the least points possible. The show is a British staple, and Her Majesty loves it!</p><h2 id=the-queen-has-also-been-said-to-watch-39-britain-39-s-got-talent-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Queen Has Also Been Said To Watch 'Britain's Got Talent'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to her penchant for quiz shows, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Queen also watched - it is said - the ocassional episode of Britain's Got Talent</a>, the competition show which seeks to find the most talented Brit in the country, whatever their talent may be. The royal is said to be impressed by the contestants who feature on the show, and has had many of them perform for her personally, such as at the Royal Albert Hall in London.</p><h2 id=like-the-rest-of-us-she-enjoys-39-downton-abbey-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Like The Rest Of Us, She Enjoys 'Downton Abbey'</span></h2><p>The Queen is also partial to a bit of fanciful entertainment, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and reportedly is an avid viewer of Downton Abbey</a> and enjoys not only the story of the aristocratic Crawley family, but also likes pointing out mistakes made in both the plot and filming of the show! Yes, the Queen has a keen eye for inaccuracies when it comes to the time period and costumes featured in the show, and often points them out to palace aides.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Downton Abbey is a national favourite, and has been watched by millions across Britain and the world. While we know Her Majesty enjoys the TV series, we can't be sure whether she has seen the movie too.</p><h2 id=the-queen-is-also-fond-of-watching-live-sport><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Queen Is Also Fond Of Watching Live Sport</span></h2><p>The Queen is a big fan of sport, as we all know, and this translates into her viewing preferences. According to sources, the royal likes to watch live sport on TV, often staying up late at night to watch overseas events - leaving her tired the next day.</p><p>Recently, the Queen kept herself awake until late at night to see British tennis star Emma Raducanu win her grand slam title at the US Open. Following Emma's stunning win, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her Majesty released a statement congratulating the young sports star</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-queen-39-s-message-to-emma-raducanu><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Queen's Message To Emma Raducanu</span></h2><p>"I send my congratulations to you on your success in winning the United States Open Championships.
