People need to eat to survive, and in our fast-paced world, more and more people are eating out. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood celebrities</a> should be the savviest when it comes to different varieties of cuisines and which ones are most lucrative because let's face it...they have the funds to eat out all week if they want to. But being a food connoisseur with a passion for tasty cuisine isn't the same as trying to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">become the next Bobby Flay</a>. The truth is, the life of a restauranteur just isn't cut out for everyone. But find out ten celebrities who tried their hands at the restaurant business but failed miserably.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears>Britney Spears</h2><p>From her recent engagement to Sam Asghari to a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit against her paternal father over being granted complete conservatorship</a> over the pop icon, Britney Spears has been in the headlines quite often throughout the years for more than one controversial topic. But it may come as a surprise to some fans that she also tried her hands in a culinary venture that didn't pan out well. Earlier in her career in 2002, it's reported that <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney invested in a New York City restaurant called Nyla</a>, which served Cajun food. However, following a breakup with pop star Justin Timberlake, she backed out of her partnership only six months after due to mismanagement of funds and a high debt accumulation. After attempting to from Cajun to Italian cuisine, Nyla eventually met an early demise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-longoria>Eva Longoria</h2><p>Known for her <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ambition as a prolific actress and entrepreneur</a>, it would make sense that Eva Longoria delved into an industry that is guaranteed, no matter the economic climate, to make money. So in late 2012, when the Desperate Housewives star decided to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">open the SHe by Morton's steakhouse in a shopping center on the Las Vegas Strip</a>, it was supposed to have hit the jackpot. Not to mention, it's Las Vegas, where people with money come to have a good time! Eva even specifically cornered the female market, serving petite steaks for ladies at a reasonable price of $36. But less than two years later, the steakhouse was shut down after health inspectors discovered 32 health violations, mainly for storing foods at improper temperatures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-costner>Kevin Costner</h2><p>Oscar-winning actor<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kevin Costner</a>, who had the pleasure of starring alongside Whitney Houston in The Bodyguard, opened a gourmet restaurant at the South Coast Plaza area in Orange County, California, in 1999 named The Clubhouse. Being no stranger to the restaurant business, Costner lost his previous food venture, Twin Palms, to Cindy Silva after their divorce in 1994. This time, he opened<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Clubhouse</a> with fellow celebrity Robert Wagner and pro-golfers Jack Nicklaus and Fred Couples. They did not intend on making it into another celebrity restaurant and only allowed a members-only experience at $50,000. They later changed the membership rules and allowed the outside to dine at reasonable prices. However, in December 2009, The Clubhouse closed its doors due to failing luster and excitement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-timberlake>Justin Timberlake</h2><p>It appears that this <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">legendary Backstreet Boy pop star</a> wasn't the only one crying a river in 2013 when his part-owned Italian restaurant, Destino, was closed for the unlikeliest of reasons. Justin Timberlake opened the restaurant in 2006 at First Avenue and 50th Street in Manhatten and was a favorite among other celebrity clientele such as Bill Cosby and former baseball player Carlos Beltran. It was preferred not only for its exceptional Italian cuisine but also for its amazing ambiance. But all <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that changed in July 2013 when plumbing issues</a> above the establishment caused sewage waste to begin leaking down the walls of the restaurant and onto the premises. This happened not once but twice and also led to mold infestation. Needless to say, that marked the end of the Italian job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-biel>Jessica Biel</h2><p>Total Recall actress <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Biel</a> brings more to the table than meets the eye. Other than her ageless features and iconic acting skill, she is also an ambitious restauranteur with out-of-the-box ideas. In March 2016, Biel partnered with stylist Estee Stanley, Joey Gonzalez, Kimberly Muller, and Jonathan Rollo to birth Au Fudge, a Los Angeles-based restaurant catering to hard-working parents and children. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People.com</a>, Au Fudge included the Au Fudge Camp, which offered children's center classes in art, science, karate, ballet, and playtime for children between 6 months and ten years old, all while Mommy and Daddy enjoyed a mouth-watering meal. However, in 2017, Au Fudge was accused by employees of stealing over $430,000 in tips and denying them meals and rest periods and sued their employers for $1 million. By 2018, Biel announced that the restaurant would be closing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ludacris>Ludacris</h2><p>It's always a pleasure to behold rappers, or any other celebrity for that matter, expanding their interests and business acumen in areas outside of their comfort zones. Innovative Atlanta rapper, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ludacris, born Christopher Brian Bridges,</a> displayed his expertise in the world of hip-hop and later transitioned that success into his acting career. But as every musician or actor finds success outside of their dominant field of interest, Ludacris stepped into unfamiliar territory by opening his first restaurant, Strait's, in 2008. Although the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Asian-fusion spot received good reviews</a> for its delicious entrees and dishes, it closed its doors in 2012 after four years in operation, possibly due to low-guest count and an unreasonably high-priced menu. Despite the setback, Ludacris was determined to succeed and opened his Chicken 'N' Beer restaurant, named after his 2003 album, in the same year Strait's closed and is still going strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-spielberg>Steven Spielberg</h2><p>The film director, producer, and screenwriter, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Spielberg</a>, who brought us outstanding movies such as Jaws, E.T., Jurassic Park, and a slew of other amazing films, also saw the potential of the food industry and decided to capitalize on its earning potential with his Los Angeles restaurant, Dive!. Out of all the movie categories he has explored, this one would be completely out of his element. But that wouldn't deter him from establishing this gourmet submarine sandwich eatery in 1994, which spread its location to<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Las Vegas</a> one year later. The idea was to give diners the illusion of being in an actual submarine, hence the name "Dive!" But by 1999, t<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he California location closed its doors to poor sales and mixed reactions to the atmosphere</a>. Then in the early 2000s, the Las Vegas branch finally sank. Nevertheless, Spielberg will never stop being a great film producer!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star-Studded Dinners: 10 Most Popular Restaurants For Celebrity-Spotting in LA, Hollywood</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>Although born and raised in the Bronx, New York, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez</a> is actually of Puerto Rican descent. Her silver-tongued Latin wit, beautiful features, musical talent, and down-to-earth persona landed her a place on the big screen, first as a music artist and then as one of Hollywood's most celebrated actresses. But, like most other celebrities who are passionate about leaving their mark on something other than movies and music, she opened her own restaurant. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madre's,</a> which is Spanish for "mother," was Cuban and Puerto Rican-themed, centering its cuisine around foods she ate as a child growing up. Six years later, in 2008, and many negative food and service reviews later, J-Lo finally closed Madre's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-puffy-combs>Sean 'Puffy' Combs</h2><p>Rap label mogul, entrepreneur, and restauranteur, Sean P. Diddy Combs, is recognized as one of the most successful rappers and producers of all time. He is just behind fellow <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West</a> as the richest rappers in the world, according to Forbes. Named after his first-born son, the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Boy executive founded Justin's in 1997</a> in New York City, offering a southern-Caribbean cuisine. By the following year, in 1998, another branch opened up in Atlanta. Both branches received massive support from other celebrities and musicians, and the New York branch even had to close in 2007 due to the need for a larger property. But the Atlanta branch put the nail in the coffin after a 2011 shooting of music executive Tony Austin in the parking lot of the eatery gave it the label of 'dangerous and hazardous conditions'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-disick>Scott Disick</h2><p>If you're a fan of the Kardashians, then you've definitely heard of Scott Disick. He rose to fame after a long run on <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a>, where he became recognized as a legitimate reality star. But in 2012, Scott decided to showcase his entrepreneurial skills and venture into restaurant ownership by launching a Japanese-Asian fusion establishment called RYU. The launching of the restaurant was announced on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which was a great marketing strategy and attracted several stars. However, from the ambiance to the food, to the choice of music - it all received poor reviews. Less than six months into its launching, Disick sold his shares in the business. In addition, Hurricane Sandy also caused havoc on the east coast of America, causing RYU to close its doors for good.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity-Owned Restaurants, Ranked From Least To Most Expensive</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> BET,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Magazine,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eater New York,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGR%2BcXnCnqOemqNixKrAx2admqGcmrFuvsSsq5qtopa7tXnBrqqippWowKa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-with-failed-restaurant-businesses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebs-with-failed-restaurant-businesses.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-with-failed-restaurant-businesses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebs-with-failed-restaurant-businesses.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-with-failed-restaurant-businesses.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-with-failed-restaurant-businesses.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./expensive-things-guy-fieri-bought.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./expensive-things-guy-fieri-bought.html>10 Hilariously Expensive Things Guy Fieri Has Bought</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-celebs-who-killed-their-spouses.html>10 Celebs Who Killed Their Spouses</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-celebs-who-killed-their-spouses.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
