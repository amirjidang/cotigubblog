And with the help of The Eras Tour, Swift's ranking is only expected to increase.</p><p>Much like the albums, Reputation, Folklore, Lover, and 1989, Midnights continues to break streaming records with not only the total number of streams but daily streams as well. With nearly 14 million independent streams yesterday alone, it should come as no surprise that the album has already been downloaded over six billion times.</p><p>With The Eras Tour being one of the most sought-after events of the year to attend, fans are streaming Swift's music, both old and new with a vengeance. But the fact that Midnights helped Swift break a Spotify record should come as no surprise given that this is not the first one broken by the Lavender Haze singer on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Is Midnights Taylor Swift's Most Successful Album So Far?</a></span></p><h2 id=39-midnights-39-broke-records-the-day-it-was-released>'Midnights' Broke Records The Day It Was Released</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-at-an-event.png><p>Midnights was released on October 21, 2022, at, appropriately, midnight. By the next day, the album and Swift had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">already broken several records on Spotify</a>. Not only was Midnights the most downloaded album in one day on the platform with 186 million streams in 24 hours, but Swift also smashed the record for the most-streamed artist, male or female, in one day on Spotify.</p><p>While those two records being broken is impressive, what is more impressive still is that just over one week after the album was released, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a total of 73 records were broken</a>. This included the most streamed album on Spotify in a five-day period, with the song Anti-Hero leading the way as the most streamed song on the global Spotify chart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the album was released, Anti-Hero debuted in the number one spot on the global Spotify chart with 17.39 million streams. The number two through five spots on the chart were also taken up by songs from Midnights, with Lavender Haze, Snow on the Beach, Maroon, and You're On Your Own, Kid racking up 16.4, 15.05. 14.4, and 12.84 million streams, respectively.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Legal Team Proved Once Again That Picking A Lawsuit Against The Artist Isn't Always The Best Idea</a></span></p><p>With these incredible numbers, it is no surprise that critics are anticipating Midnights to break seven billion streams by the time the album reaches one year old.</p><h2 id=39-midnights-39-helped-taylor-swift-have-five-consecutive-number-one-albums>'Midnights' Helped Taylor Swift Have Five Consecutive Number One Albums</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to the Spotify records that Swift and Midnights continue to break, the album also helped the Sweet Nothing singer break a record that only the elite of the music industry has been able to do in the past. And that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">record is having five consecutive years of number-one albums</a>.</p><p>Starting with 2019's release of Lover, Swift started a trend of having her albums reach the top of the Billboard 200. As Folklore, Evermore, Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Midnights, and Speak Now (Taylor's Version), were released, Swift found herself inching closer to joining industry elite with having five consecutive years of number one albums reaching the top of the chart. With the release of Speak Now (Taylor's Version), Swift joined The Beatles, Drake, Jay-Z, and Paul McCartney as the only artists ever able to do this. She is also the only woman to ever achieve this feat as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, Swift was able to hold all the songs on the Billboard Top 10 at one time, <a href=#>thanks in part to her greatest hits</a> as well as the songs from Midnights. This is a feat that has never been achieved by any other artist in the history of the chart.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Sets An Industry Standard By Giving Her Tour Staff $55 Million In Bonuses</a></span></p><p>Just how many more streams Midnight will have or how many albums will be sold, is not clear. But with Swift being one of the most, if not the most popular artists on Spotify and other streaming platforms at the moment, there are sure to be more records broken as the year progresses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkqeyorfSZqSaq6Oew6Z50Z6aqKqUYsSqwMdmqqmnpJ6zunnFqKlmpZmZu6qzx62qaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-breaks-massive-record-with-spotify-for-midnights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-breaks-massive-record-with-spotify-for-midnights.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-breaks-massive-record-with-spotify-for-midnights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-breaks-massive-record-with-spotify-for-midnights.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-breaks-massive-record-with-spotify-for-midnights.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-breaks-massive-record-with-spotify-for-midnights.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-nearly-passed-out-on-stage-during-1989-tour.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-nearly-passed-out-on-stage-during-1989-tour.html>Taylor Swift Nearly Passed Out On Stage During Her Demanding 1989 Tour</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./step-by-step-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Step by Step Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./step-by-step-cast-where-are-they-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
