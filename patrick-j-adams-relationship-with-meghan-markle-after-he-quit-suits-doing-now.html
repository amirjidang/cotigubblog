Each and every one of them."</p><p>During their time working together, Adams and Markle developed a strong friendship. <a href=#>Adams and their former Suits co-stars even attended Markle's royal wedding</a> at Windsor Castle in London, England.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Patrick J.

"After our children were born, there were some texts sent and gifts sent, but I guess I'm a little scared. I think it's pure fear. I guess I'm scared about the idea of breaking through whatever walls exist to have that conversation."</p><p>He further explained, "Quite frankly, I think I'm intimidated. I have no doubt I could pick up the phone and call her at any moment, but I don't know what I would say."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Gabriel Macht And Jacinda Barrett's Relationship With Meghan Markle After Suits</a></span></p><p>Despite this, the two have exchanged a few texts, mainly centered on the subject of parenting. Adams was quick to clarify that his hesitation is primarily due to Markle's incredibly busy and imposing schedule, "We don't spend any time together, but that's not because of anything other than how completely enormous her life has become in so many ways," he explained via Today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-j-adams-expressed-his-support-for-meghan-markle-and-defended-her-against-media-scrutiny>Patrick J.

"Hello to the people and many bots debating all things Markle and including me in the conversation. I just want you to know a couple of things. 1. I don't read any of it. 2. Life is short. 3. There has to got to be better things for you to be doing.

That didn't feel right for him. It didn't feel right for where I was at in my life, either… It just felt like it was the way to go."</p><p>Adams told the publication that he intends to have a break and spend quality time at home with his wife, Pretty Little Liars alum Troian Bellisario, and their dogs.
