The pair met in 2015, shortly after Cavill split from Gina Carano, and dated for around a year. Cavill spoke highly about his then-girlfriend, King, and their age difference.

A source told The Sun, "Henry said the two of them could remain friends, and he even invited her to his recent birthday party, which she went to, but the relationship is over."</p><p>The source close to King admitted, “It has been very difficult for Tara, who has been saying he was the love of her life.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Kaley Cuoco And Henry Cavill Date As A Publicity Stunt?</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Cavill is currently dating girlfriend Natalie Viscuso</a>, who is about 6 years younger than the actor. While Cavill appears happy with the TV executive, he did have to calm his fans down who were sending abuse to his partner. “Now, while I do appreciate the passion and support by those very people who are ‘speculating,’ It has come to such a point that I needed to say something, which in itself, is a bad thing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added a message to those "who are expressing your disdain and showing your displeasure through a surprising variety of ways." The star begged his fans to stop their inappropriate behavior. "I know it can be fun to speculate, to gossip, and to dive into our own personal echo chambers on the internet, but your “passion” is misplaced, and it causes harm to the people I care about most.”</p><p>Cavill concluded by telling his loyal fanbase, “I am very happy in love, and in life,” adding, “I’d be enormously grateful if you were happy with me.”</p><h2 id=why-henry-cavill-dates-younger-women>Why Henry Cavill Dates Younger Women</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-20.jpg><p>In a Playboy interview, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Henry Cavill claimed he dated younger women for practical reasons</a>. He explained that it was challenging to date someone who also had their own career, and he preferred women who were yet to establish their own work life. These comments were met with controversy at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He admitted it was "tough" to date someone like him if they also had a busy lifestyle. "If I want someone who’s a professional, they’ve got their own s*** going on. So unless I meet someone who’s very, very young who hasn’t yet started trying a career like that, you can then go, ‘Okay, I’m going to travel with you and do some stuff, maybe I’ll write or whatever; I’ll entertain myself or build my own kind of traveling career.'”</p><p>The Tudors actor explained that while he would like to have a relationship with an age-appropriate partner, he's come to understand that unequal relationships could be toxic. "I’m looking for someone who’s my own age and will have a career. If they haven’t, then maybe I should be worried. It’s easier said than done."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Witcher Showrunner Lauren Hissrich Revealed The Struggles Of Working With Henry Cavill</a></span></p><p>These statements weren't the only ones of Henry Cavill's controversial dating comments in recent years. In 2018, the actor made insensitive remarks about the #MeToo movement and how it negatively impacted his dating life.</p><p>“It’s very difficult to do that if there are certain rules in place. Because then it’s like: ‘Well, I don’t want to go up and talk to her, because I’m going to be called a rapist or something. So you’re like, ‘Forget it, I’m going to call an ex-girlfriend instead, and then just go back to a relationship, which never really worked.’"</p><p>He also suggested that flirting with somebody would be like “casting myself into the fires of hell”, as a celebrity in the public eye. The Enola Holmes actor also said he thinks “stuff has to change” in regards to the behavior of some men, but that “it’s important to also retain the good things, which were a quality of the past, and get rid of the bad things.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">He later apologized for the comments after they received backlash</a>. "I just wanted to apologize for any confusion and misunderstanding that this may have created. Insensitivity was absolutely not my intention.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqairnqkrdWio6Vll56%2FrbLRopynnF2axW6txp5koJmgYrCwucyepa2rXayus77Ap6uenF2prrOtjKSgp59f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhenry-cavill-girlfriend-ex-age-gap-comments-warranted-tara-king.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhenry-cavill-girlfriend-ex-age-gap-comments-warranted-tara-king.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhenry-cavill-girlfriend-ex-age-gap-comments-warranted-tara-king.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhenry-cavill-girlfriend-ex-age-gap-comments-warranted-tara-king.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhenry-cavill-girlfriend-ex-age-gap-comments-warranted-tara-king.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhenry-cavill-girlfriend-ex-age-gap-comments-warranted-tara-king.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jordan-summer-house-exit-what-hes-doing-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jordan-summer-house-exit-what-hes-doing-now.html>Why Jordan Verroi Was Kicked Out Of Summer House And What He's Doing Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mattie-westbrouck-wiki-biography.html>Who is Mattie Westbrouck?
