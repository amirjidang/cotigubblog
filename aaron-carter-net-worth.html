In 2017, patriarch Bob Carter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">died at the age of 65</a>, visiting further grief upon the embattled family.</p><p>At the same time, Aaron Carter was widely associated with substance abuse, and negative stories about him proliferated in the media.</p><p>Moreover, there was no one to come to Aaron's aid in battling the allure of drugs — especially Nick, who had looked out for Aaron more than anyone.</p><p>As a result, one of the most shocking family feuds began to play out on social media. Aaron alleged that his older brother had abused him, and maintained that Nick had treated him poorly throughout his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, the feud between Aaron and Nick Carter escalated further, when both Nick and Aaron’s twin sister, Angel, sought a restraining order against Aaron.</p><p><strong>Updated, April 2024: </strong>In late April, Variety.com <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on a forthcoming documentary</a> focused on Nick Carter, Aaron Carter, and allegations made against the former:</p><p>"Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter and his late brother Aaron Carter — and the controversies and accusations swirling around both of them — will be the subject of the latest high-profile documentary series on Investigation Discovery ... Max will jointly run the four-part docuseries 'Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter' over two nights, on Monday, May 27, and Tuesday, May 28, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>"In particular, the series will investigate the accusations of sexual assault against Nick Carter by three women, and will also dive into younger brother Aaron Carter’s struggles with mental health and substance abuse, leading to his death in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"'Fallen Idols' will additionally look at the relationship between the brothers, which took a turn when Aaron Carter began criticizing Nick Carter for those allegations and supporting his accusers.</p><p>At the same time, Aaron's twin sister, Angel Carter, disclosed plans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to posthumously release new music</a> recorded by her late brother, with a harrowing message attached: "Learn from our story."</p><p>Angel, who is one of only two surviving Carter siblings, attributed her family tragedies to "generational dysfunction," and spoke candidly about what fame and fortune did to the Carter family. She explained:</p><p>"Once money started coming in, you know we were a family that had no money,. We were from upstate New York. My parents were poor, and they had never seen anything like this before, so once the money started coming in, it really started changing the dynamic because money became the moving force."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angel Carter also spoke of the potential for her brother to still do good in the world, and said:</p><p>"The good in this situation is that Aaron does have this platform and my family has this platform and I would like to turn this ship around and to really start helping some other people and to learn from our story."</p><p>Nick alleged that Aaron had threatened to harm Nick’s pregnant wife and unborn child. Aaron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vehemently denied all the allegations</a>.</p><p>But the social media bickering between the once-close brothers continued; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron went on to side with Melissa Schuman</a>, a former member of the pop group Dream, who had filed a lawsuit against Nick Carter for alleged sexual abuse.</p><p>According to Aaron (at the time), Nick had purportedly assaulted other girls. Initially, Nick dodged the allegations when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">authorities asserted that the statute of limitations</a> had expired in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, in 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa Schuman again filed a lawsuit</a> against Nick, and two additional women filed similar suits based on similar allegations. In turn, Nick Carter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sued all three accusers for defamation</a>.</p><p>When the claims first arose in 2017, those who believed Nick's denials often asserted that Aaron was "not well," that he was obsessed with his brother, and that he was bolstering the allegations to seek attention (or to otherwise get back at Nick).</p><p>In 2019, Carter family matters got even messier when, in a shocking turn of events, Aaron publicly claimed that his deceased sister Leslie had sexually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">abused him for three years</a>, when he was between the ages of ten and 13.</p><p>By that point, Aaron was thoroughly isolated and without support; his siblings remained estranged from him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He had filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and blamed his parents because, according to Aaron, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he earned around $200 million</a> from when he was seven until he turned 18, but he only received $2 million when he came of age.</p><p>Like many tragic stars before him, when Aaron was successful, everyone stood by his side.

They were detoxing me, but there was also a psychiatrist, and a therapist that I worked with almost daily, and they’re the ones who put me on the kind of medications that I need to be on ...</p><p>I'll say here right in front of all y'all, I’m not ashamed of it. I have issues. I have post-traumatic stress disorder. I never wanted my parents to divorce. I never wanted my dad to die. I never wanted my sister to die at 27.</p><p>In 2017, Aaron released an album which did not perform as well as some of his earlier efforts, but it was met with a decent reception, and nearly a million sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Aaron found love, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meeting Bulgarian bartender Melanie Martin</a>.
