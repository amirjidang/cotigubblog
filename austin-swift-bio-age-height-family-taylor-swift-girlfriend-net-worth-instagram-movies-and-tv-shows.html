His father, Scott Kingsley Swift, worked as a stockbroker and his mother, Andrea Swift, is a homemaker. In 2015, his mother was diagnosed with cancer and received treatment for the same.</p><p>The news was devastating for Austin and Taylor Swift, as both have always idolized their mother. However, with the encouragement from his family, he launched his Hollywood career and began starring in movies in 2016. He is presently working for the film ‘Cover Versions’, which is yet to hit the box office.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=austin-swift-career></span><span>Austin Swift Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During his college years, he worked as a freelancing photographer for ‘Getty Images’ and also snapped his sister for the ‘People Magazine’. He also performed in several plays such as ‘Six Characters in Search of An Author’ and ‘Dead Man’s Cell Phone’. Theatre redefined his career choice and exposed him to the world of entertainment.</p><p>Thus, in 2016 he was cast in a cameo role in Ben Affleck’s ‘Life By Night’ as Mayweather. The same year he worked in the movie ‘I.T’ alongside Pierce Brosnan as ‘Lance’. In 2017, he will be seen playing the lead role of a band member, in the mystery thriller ‘Cover Versions’.</p><p>Austin is not only strikingly charming but also hardworking. After graduating from university, he has worked in three films within two years, and the third being a lead role. His unconditional love for photography has driven his ‘Instagram’ account to extreme heights. It is quite evident, that he can capture a zillion thoughts and emotions in just a frame.</p><p>Thus, his talent in both acting and photography is equally placed, and he seems to be giving both his passions equal priorities. It is unimaginable, that he managed to stay away from all the limelight and dedicate his time towards his education with his sister being rated as the number one country artist of her era. But Austin stayed humble and worked his way to fame on his own strength.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=austin-swift-age></span><span>Austin Swift Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin was born on March 11, 1992, and is currently 27 years old as of 2019. his birth sign is Pisces.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=austin-swift-height></span><span>Austin Swift Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin stands 6 feet and 2 inches tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=austin-swift-net-worth></span><span>Austin Swift Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin has an estimated net worth of 200 million dollars as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=austin-swift-girlfriend></span><span>Austin Swift Girlfriend</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Austin hasn’t been linked to anyone.
