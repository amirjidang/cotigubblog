Born on August 15, 1990, in Louisville, Kentucky, she actually got into acting as a way of dealing with her social anxiety and hyperactivity during her childhood.</p><p>Those acting roles consisted mainly of local church plays and school musicals, but it paid off when she was spotted on the street <a href=#>in New York City</a> during a family vacation when she was just 14 years old. Her talent was immediately detected and she soon signed with a talent agency and began auditioning for roles in Los Angeles. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Her subsequent success as an actress has earned her $160 million, and with it a few trinkets and properties, one of the newest being a $21.9 million townhouse in NYC's West Village. Let's take a look at what this brand new duplex has to offer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=living-pretty-in-the-city>Living Pretty In The City</h2><p>If you're being cast alongside Hollywood stars like Rose Byrne,<a href=#> The Bourne Legacy's Oscar Isaac</a>, Bradley Cooper, and the Jurassic World protagonist Chris Pratt, then you're able to afford one of the priciest condos in New York City. Located on 17 Jane Street between Greenwich and Eighth Avenue in West Village, the property was designed by Sir. David Chipperfield, the head of the international architectural firm bearing his name, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to City Realty</a>.</p><p>The developer of the project, Edward Minskoff, stated that he intentionally sought after a highly adept architect like Chipperfield for the job since his track record of other New York designs includes a redesigned contemporary art wing of the Metropolitan Museum as well as a new headquarters tower for the <a href=#>luxury watch company, Rolex</a>.&nbsp;Edward Minskoff also occupies the top two floors of the building.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The capacious pad is spread across&nbsp;6,378 square feet and spans two floors, giving the Oscar-winning actress plenty of living and playing space for her and her husband's first child, who was born in April 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by E-News</a>. The six-story building displays a red-brick design measuring 85 feet high, which is modest considering it's home to some of <a href=#>the most expansive and extravagant hotels in New York City</a>. Other outstanding exterior features that may have drawn an A-list actress like Lawrence include Roman-course brickwork, traditional lintels, and bronze casement windows.&nbsp;Hopefully, this townhouse would be a much better investment than her Upper East Side penthouse, which she sold at a loss for $9.9 million against a purchase price of $15.6 million back in 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Hunger Games Cast Members, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-interior-masterpiece>The Interior Masterpiece</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fitted with four bedrooms and two master suite bathrooms, Lawrence and her husband will have plenty of sleeping options if the baby decides to keep them awake at night. There is also an elegant walk-in closet. Designed with an open-plan layout, the modern-style chef's kitchen is hand-painted in black and white contrast with a huge center island. Both the kitchen and the sprawling living room are situated on the first floor. In addition, it also boasts its own terrace which gives Lawrence access to a <a href=#>beautifully landscaped garden</a> at the rear of the home, providing a serene hangout spot for romantic dinners or a light get-together.</p><p>The beige wood-paneled flooring also contrasts perfectly with the dark double glass door frames leading to the outdoor garden space as well as the formal dining room table near the great room. The clean white walls also add to the spacious atmosphere and brighten the entire interior with the natural light from outside, not forgetting to mention the 13-foot ceilings that add to the roominess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upstairs are the separate bedrooms which are just as modern, classy, and spacious as the dining and lounging rooms and is equipped wit its own glass door-entrance to the outdoor garden. Also included upstairs are media, lounge, and game rooms just in case the <a href=#>Don't Look Up actress </a>gets bored of the city and decides to do some R&R indoors.</p><h2 id=additional-features-of-the-house>Additional Features Of The House</h2><p>Another portion of the multi-million-dollar duplex, the cellular level, also boasts a laundry room for Lawrence's luxury apparel, and access to the building's gym. Also featured is private elevator providing them access through a private gate and exclusive doorway on to Jane Street. While she may not be able to haul the entire 9 vehicles in her <a href=#>epic car collection</a>, but she should be able to squeeze in the Tesla Model X and maybe her Cadillac Escalade.&nbsp;And while we're on the topic of cars and garages, did you know that the six-story structure was actually erected on the site of a former two-story garage?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Knews</a>, Lawrence and her husband, Cooke Maroney, can now add the new West Village pad to their other Manhattan escape just a stone's throw away at the Tribeca building at 443 Greenwich, which is famous for the many celebrities it houses such as <a href=#>Hollywood power couple Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel</a>, Top Gun actress Meg Ryan, and actor, comedian, and entrepreneur Ryan Reynolds to name a few.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Ways In Which Jennifer Lawrence Earned Millions</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">City Realty</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knews</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E-News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ5yZ6lp6GWmr9uuMCwqZ6mk5rAbn6RZqSipJyevK951p6qrWWmnrmtrcaeZJynnpm8cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-jennifer-lawrences-22-million-west-village-condo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-jennifer-lawrences-22-million-west-village-condo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-jennifer-lawrences-22-million-west-village-condo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-jennifer-lawrences-22-million-west-village-condo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-jennifer-lawrences-22-million-west-village-condo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-jennifer-lawrences-22-million-west-village-condo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-camille-grammer-still-married-who-is-camille-grammers-husband-480676-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-camille-grammer-still-married-who-is-camille-grammers-husband-480676-html.html>Is Camille Grammer Still Married, Who Is Camille Grammers Husband?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-neuter-a-cat.html>How Much Does It Cost to Neuter a Cat?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-neuter-a-cat.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
