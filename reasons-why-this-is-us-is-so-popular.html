The American family drama covers numerous time frames following the family of two parents and their three beloved children. The story revolves around the mother who gave birth to triplets where one of the three children ended up dying. The couple decided to adopt one more baby on the same day which was abandoned at a local fire station just to make their family complete again. The <a href=#>series cast include Mandy Moore</a>, Milo Ventimiglia, Justin Hartley, Sterling K. Brown and Chrissy Metz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series has been nominated for numerous awards and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV series has been a huge hit to the viewers</a>. One of the star Sterling K. Brown even won an NAACP Image Award, an Emmy, Golden Globe and Critics’ Choice Award for his portrayal of the role of Randall Pearson. The series is now one of the biggest hit series in the US and is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now gearing up to end the show </a>once and for all.

It is the first show in a long time which nails what it’s really like being a parent, a child and sibling. The dialogues between the characters are the perfect example how things really happen in real life. The show has the perfect combination of witty, flawed, emotionally convicting and self-deprecating characters of the show. Everyone seems to agree the entire time every time the characters talk. Some series show parenthood on TV which seemed to be so different on the real life happening.</p><h2 id=the-imperfection-of-the-characters><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Imperfection Of The Characters</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The imperfection of the characters on the show is just plain relatable to everyone. All the characters messed up and no one is perfect which makes the show believable. <a href=#>Mandy Moore who plays as Rebecca</a> is selfish and lied to William, and she does not say nice things to Jack. Jack on the other hand just drinks too much while Kevin is a self-absorbed person who is also very needy. Kath can also be a hot mess while Toby is a jerk. Everyone seems to have their own flaws which make the viewers empathetic to the characters. Obviously no one is perfect, and the series perfectly shows that it is okay to have flaws.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mandy Moore Gets ‘This Is Us’ Fans Excited With Behind The Scenes Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=feeling-the-characters-39-struggles><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Feeling The Characters' Struggles</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Struggling with weight is something almost everyone experienced at one point in their lives. Most girls stood up in front of their closet mirrors to try some clothes on. The clothes might have gotten too tight which can result to some frustrations and struggles especially for moms who just had their babies. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate is open and honest with her struggles</a> when it comes to her obesity which gives a voice to what everyone seems to be saying quietly to themselves. The viewers seem to cheer on Kate on her struggles to lose those extra weights hoping to win their own personal battle against their own weight.</p><h2 id=the-fantastic-storyline><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Fantastic Storyline</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the main attractions of the show to the viewers is <a href=#>This is Us’ great storylines </a>which kept the viewers wanting for more. The storyline keeps the viewers to tune in time and again. The credit for these amazing storyline is Dan Fogelman who has created the series who is also responsible for the write-up of the 54 episodes of <strong>This is Us</strong>. What makes the storyline so good is it makes the audience wondering about the missing piece of the puzzle as the story moves backward and forward at the same time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The One Theory 'This Is Us' Fans Might Be Right About</a></span></p><h2 id=the-comedy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Comedy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the show has more of a serious storyline majority of the time, there are also some comedic elements through the show which gives off some light vibes into it. <a href=#>Kate Pearson played by Chrissy Metz</a> is the perfect example of an actress who can pull off switching from delivering a performance with such emotional and meaningful performance and then eventually throwing some one-liner jokes with ease. Chris Sullivan playing as Toby Damon is also someone who can perfectly pull off some comedic stunts on the show.</p><h2 id=the-nostalgia-of-the-80s><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Nostalgia Of The 80s</span></h2><p><a href=#>Nothing can compare to the 80s era</a>. During the flashback scenes of Rebecca and Jack, the people can catch glimpses of what life really looked like during the 80s which most fans think as the days people yearn. Gone are the days of big hairs and tube socks which seemed so cool and fun. The entire vibe of the scenes whether it is the jean skirt of Rebecca or the bedroom of Randall and Kevin is such a mood. It does serve as a simple walk down to the memory lane of the 80s which the people can revisit their childhood as they tune in weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-compelling-timeline-switch><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Compelling Timeline Switch</span></h2><p>This Is Us differs from other TV series because it switches between different timelines. The switching of the timeline makes the story more interesting as the events from different timelines are somehow interlinked and eventually relevant to the present day as the element of its storyline. Since the series is not played out as the usual chronological order of events, the show builds up excitement and suspense for the audience.</p><h2 id=the-effective-use-of-music><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Effective Use of Music</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The use of music in each scene is worth noting as the background music <a href=#>effectively reflects the emotions of the characters</a> on the story. The delivery and performance of the actors combined with the best fitting music as the background makes the scene perfect. The singing prowess of Mandy Moore and Chrissy Metz is also a great addition to the show as it shows their outstanding vocal ability.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Jamie Foxx Proves He's Just As 'Normal' As The Rest Of Us In This Instagram Post</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnpmjpLu0edahsGasmJ7AbrXSZqysZZmoerS7jKmmqa2clr9w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freasons-why-this-is-us-is-so-popular.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2freasons-why-this-is-us-is-so-popular.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2freasons-why-this-is-us-is-so-popular.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2freasons-why-this-is-us-is-so-popular.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freasons-why-this-is-us-is-so-popular.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2freasons-why-this-is-us-is-so-popular.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./did-disney-ruin-star-wars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./did-disney-ruin-star-wars.html>Here's Why Fans Say Disney Ruined 'Star Wars'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./everything-we-know-about-dj-dramas-girlfriend-as-american-dj-says-shes-the-one-for-life.html>Everything We Know About Dj Dramas Girlfriend As American DJ Says Shes The One For Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./everything-we-know-about-dj-dramas-girlfriend-as-american-dj-says-shes-the-one-for-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
