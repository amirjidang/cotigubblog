Shedding their punk-tinged, screamo style metalcore early on, Avenged adopted the old school, pure metal style and have been on a meteoric rise ever since. With a few band member changes and some experimentation with their sound, the band has become rather polarizing to metal purists, but despite the small pocket of haters, Avenged has gone on to generate huge record sales and huge bank accounts for its members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Heavy Metal Godfather Ozzy Osbourne Dislikes The Term Heavy Metal</a></span></p><p>But of all the band’s illustrious, tattoo laden members, who has the most money tucked away in the bank? Each member of<strong> Avenged Sevenfold</strong> has not only generated large death from the band but have also ventured off and pursued other endeavors, all while raking in the green stuff. This list wishes to shed light on exactly which of Avenged Sevenfold’s member's wallets are ready to burst.</p><h2 id=the-rev-1-9-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Rev: $1.9 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, <strong>The Rev</strong> passed back in December 2009. A young man of only 28, Jimmy Sullivan went far too soon. However, <strong>Avenged Sevenfold’s</strong> late drummer managed to accumulate a <strong>$1.9 Million</strong> net worth during his time with the band before passing. The Rev was a dynamic drummer and the heart of the first iteration of Avenged. <strong>Jim </strong>was “Double riding” all the way to the bank before his unfortunate and untimely passing.</p><h2 id=arin-ilejay-7-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Arin Ilejay: $7 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Arin Ilejay’s</strong> time in <strong>Avenged</strong> was brief but impactful. Replacing <strong>The Rev</strong> as the band’s permanent drummer, Ilejay recorded one album (Hail To The King in 2013) and toured with Avenged until July 2015, leaving the band due to creative differences (he was also quite a bit younger than the rest of the band). However, it wasn't all frowns and sorrow for Ilejay after his departure from the band, as the young drummer managed to accumulate quite a chunk of change for himself. Leaving with a <strong>$7 million </strong>net worth, Arin has moved on to other bands and other ventures, all of which he will surely add to his already impressive bank account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dad Organizes Heavy Metal Concert For Son With Cerebral Palsy Because Nothing Can Stop Metal</a></span></p><h2 id=mike-portnoy-8-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mike Portnoy: $8 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Mike Portnoy</strong> was the long-time drummer for the progressive metal band<strong> Dream Theatre</strong>; however,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the New York native lent his drumming talents to <strong>Avenged Sevenfold </strong>back in 2010</a>, briefly replacing the late Jimmy “The Rev” Sullivan on the album Nightmare and the subsequent tour. Portnoy would eventually be replaced by Arin Ilejay, but added a handsome sum to his net worth before his exit. Mike is currently worth a cool <strong>$8 million</strong> thanks to his time with Avenged, his work with Dream Theatre and his other projects including Adrenaline Mob, Transatlantic, Yellow Matter Custard, Flying Colors, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brooks-wackerman-12-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Brooks Wackerman: $12 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Brooks Wackerman</strong> is Avenged Sevenfold’s current drummer.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Replacing Arin Ilejay back in November 2015, Brooks worked on the 2016’s The Stage and has since toured extensively with Avenged</a>. Before becoming the permanent drummer for the Avenged Sevenfold, Wackerman was in a myriad of bands such as Bad4Good, Infectious Grooves, Glenn Tipton, Mass Mental, Suicidal Tendencies, The Vandals, and<strong> </strong>he played with<strong> Avril Lavigne </strong>(Bad Religion being the most notable and his longest gig to date). Brooks has amassed a <strong>$12 million </strong>net worth throughout the years. Seems pounding on the drums has certainly paid off.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look At Jason Momoa's Obsession With Heavy Metal</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=synyster-gates-16-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Synyster Gates: $16 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Synyster Gates </strong>(real name Brian Haner Jr.) is the lead guitarist of Avenged Sevenfold. Before joining Avenged, Gates was a member of the Avant-garde metal band Pinkly Smooth with childhood friend and former Avenged bandmate the late Jimmy “The Rev” Sullivan. With the success of<strong> Avenged Sevenfold, </strong>his other ventures such as a clothing line and even joining bandmate and brother-in-law <strong>M. Shadows</strong> in a collaboration with Machine Gun Kelly, Gates is currently worth a hefty<strong> $16 million. </strong>Synyster Gates?

Frequently playing dueling harmonies with fellow axe slinger Synyster Gates, Zacky has done rather well for himself.
