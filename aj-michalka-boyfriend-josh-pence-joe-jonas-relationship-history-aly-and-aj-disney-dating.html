Not only were they featured in a number of major Disney Channel projects, but they also made it huge with their music. "Into the Rush", in particular, was a massive hit for them. So, it's only natural for some fans to wonder <a href=#>what happened to Aly And AJ Michalka</a>. But fans of the gorgeous sisters know that they've been extremely busy with their acting and music careers. AJ, in particular, has been knocking it out of the park on television. But that doesn't mean she hasn't had time for relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many young Hollywood starlets, AJ Michalka has had her fair share of romantic flings and long-term relationships. Some of the people she's been linked to may surprise even some of her biggest fans, while others have been extremely well-documented. Here's the truth about all of AJ Michalka's past boyfriends and her current relationship with actor Josh Pence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aj-michalka-has-dated-a-few-notable-men>AJ Michalka Has Dated A Few Notable Men</h2><p>AJ Michalka has not been shy about the men in her life. She has a history of displaying quite a bit on her Instagram, but only when things are serious. The singer's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> first notable boyfriend</a> was none other than her Disney Channel colleague, Joe Jonas. While the Jonas Brother was still in his puritan days back in 2005, he was very much involved with AJ. In fact, according to Seventeen, the two actually dated for about a year. This is a little bit crazy to think about given that <a href=#>Joe is now married and has a kid with Sophie Turner</a>. Boy, have things changed.</p><p>On top of dating for a year, Joe was actually AJ's first kiss. "It happened at a bowling alley in middle America on tour in like, Michigan," she told BuzzFeed in 2016. "[The Jonas Brothers] opened for us when we were all like, 15, and so we started dating and we were together for a year."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though <a href=#>Joe was called out by his first lover</a>, it seems as though AJ has nothing but nice things to say about him. Although, in fairness, it seems as though she has had pretty positive breakups with all of her boyfriends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Aly And AJ Have Done Separately Before Reuniting As A Duo</a></span></p><p>In 2008, AJ was briefly linked to famous skateboarder Ryan Sheckler, starting kind of a trend of dating shorter, blonde, California-types. While neither AJ nor Ryan ever confirmed their relationship, they did admit to hanging out numerous times. On top of this, they were photographed together more than twice. Immediately after this, she dated Ryan Sheckler lookalike Bennet Heimple. While there are tons of PDA-filled photos of the then-teenage couple on the internet, the two ultimately didn't last more than a few months.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Aly Michalka Been Up To Since 'Hellcats'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shorly after her break-up with Bennet, AJ found herself another hunky blonde in 17 Again star Hunter Parish. This was the first time that AJ really showed off her boyfriend in public. They even attended the 2009 Teen Choice Awards together, according to Just Jared.</p><p>After about a year, AJ broke up with Hunter and briefly dated Ryan Blair, and then Harrison Mead for a year. In late 2013, AJ entered a relationship that appeared to be pretty serious. This was with Bates Motel and Day of the Dead star Keenan Tracey. The pair met on the set of Motive when they both guest-starred on the Canadian crime series. Their relationship last for a couple of years which was clearly difficult on them both as Keenan lived in Vancouver, B.C., and AJ in L.A. But the pair used any excuse to travel back and forth. Addionally, AJ's sister Aly was living in Vancouver so it made the long-distance relationship easier, according to Just Jared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>AJ and Keenan's relationship was so serious that the couple was introduced to all of each other's friends and the singer took the hunky actor to her sister's wedding in Italy. However, their relationship fizzled out and Keenan was spotted with another one of his female co-stars, Priscilla Quintana. Although it appears they are still on good terms as AJ was just spotted in Vancouver at one of Keenan's art shows. After Keenan, AJ appeared to take a break from dating in order to focus on The Goldbergs and her music career... and then came Josh Pence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aj-michalka-39-s-current-boyfriend-is-josh-pence>AJ Michalka's Current Boyfriend Is Josh Pence</h2><p>Four years ago, AJ Michalka fell for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the secret star of The Social Networ</a>k, Josh Pence. While some know Josh as Tony Hughes from Revenge or as Young Ra's Al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises, Josh actually played Armie Hammer's Twin in The Social Network. His face was just edited out in order to copy Armie's in order to bring Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to life.</p><p>On August 8th, 2021, AJ took to her Instagram to celebrate the fact that she and Josh has spent four years together. This means that their relationship started somewhere around the time Josh starred in Aly and AJ's music video for "Take Me".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to her Instagram, AJ and Josh do pretty much everything together.
