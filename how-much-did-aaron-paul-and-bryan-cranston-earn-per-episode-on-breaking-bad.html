Not only has it opened the doors for both stars to carry on with successful careers in Hollywood, but it also earned them a fortune thanks to their lucrative contracts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, TV Guide released its annual salary report of the highest-paid actors, personalities and hosts on television, and on that list were the notable mentions of Paul and Cranston, who made quite a fortune from the fifth and final series of the crime-drama, which included 16 episodes.</p><p>According to the report, Cranston, who already had an impressive resume before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signing on for the show back in 2008</a>, earned an incredible $225,000 per episode while his co-star was said to have earned $150,000. Paul’s sum is particularly interesting since he was supposed to be killed off at the end of season one.</p><p>But after the script was revised, not only did he reprise his role for the entire five seasons, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he&nbsp;also starred in the Netflix spin-off flick</a>, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Story, which would have earned him another hefty sum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/breaking-bad-cast.jpg><h2 id=how-much-did-aaron-paul-and-bryan-cranston-earn-on-breaking-bad>How Much Did Aaron Paul And Bryan Cranston Earn On ‘Breaking Bad’?</h2><p>For the fifth and final series, Branston, who already had a string of successful TV shows under his belt with The Louie Show, Eagle Riders, Seinfeld, and Malcolm in the Middle, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned the most money with $225,000 per episode</a>.</p><p>It was said that Cranston’s salary matched the cast of How I Met Your Mother, who were believed to be making $200k-230k per episode while Damian Lewis was making a little more on Homeland with $250,000.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking Bad: A Ranking Of The Cast (According To Their Net Worth)</a></span></p><p>Paul, on the other hand, took home a whopping $150,000 for each episode and considering there were 16 episodes in the fifth season, the 41-year-old would have made $2.4 million for the entire series while his co-star walked away with $3.6 million. Quite impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while it’s been seven years since the final season wrapped, the show continued to hold a special place in Paul’s heart, who said in an interview with The Guardian that his entire life was changed the minute he signed up for the role of Jesse Pinkman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aaron-paul-breaking-bad-still.jpg><p>“People were just so passionate, and wanted answers. Asking when the next series of&nbsp;Breaking Bad&nbsp;was gonna be – you can put that dream away – wanting to know what happens to Jesse. And what happened to Jesse. A lot of people will always see me as Jesse, and I take that as a compliment. The show was a game changer.”</p><p>“I lived and breathed every moment of his life that we saw, and then some.

So if it’s a story you want to tell, so I am happy to go on this journey with you.’ He told me, ‘I don’t want to do this film unless I truly believe it’s perfect. So I’ll get back to you when I finish writing it.” Seven months later, he gave me a call and said, ‘the script is done.’ And it’s pretty great.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the most noteworthy awards that Breaking Bad won during its five-year run on television include a Golden Globe award for Best TV Series - Drama in 2014 and a two-time consecutive Emmy win in 2013 and 2014 for Outstanding Drama Series.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Of Jesse Pinkman: 12 Of His Best B-Bombs On Breaking Bad, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lkZa%2FsLqMqZiupF2Wu6V5wauwmqZdmL%2BiutKtpqdllZa%2Fr3nPnqlmnaCewLCwxGamp2WSp7Kit8innmaakZl8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-did-aaron-paul-and-bryan-cranston-earn-per-episode-on-breaking-bad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-much-did-aaron-paul-and-bryan-cranston-earn-per-episode-on-breaking-bad.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-did-aaron-paul-and-bryan-cranston-earn-per-episode-on-breaking-bad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-much-did-aaron-paul-and-bryan-cranston-earn-per-episode-on-breaking-bad.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-did-aaron-paul-and-bryan-cranston-earn-per-episode-on-breaking-bad.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-aaron-paul-and-bryan-cranston-earn-per-episode-on-breaking-bad.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hunter-renfroe-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hunter-renfroe-net-worth.html>Hunter Renfroe Net Worth How Much is Renfroe Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html>How Comedian Chelsea Handler Spends Her $35 Million Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
