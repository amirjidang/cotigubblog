The biggest budget film of all time up until that point (coming in at a colossal $200 million), it went on to gross an astonishing $2 billion at the box office after its initial release and numerous re-runs. Its success was almost completely unprecedented, and the movie has established itself firmly into pop culture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was also the film which made its star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kate Winslet</strong></a> into a household name. After Heavenly Creatures, the movie came as her second major film role, and director James Cameron was taking a big chance on the twenty-one-year-old actress when he cast her as his Rose.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Kate Winslet Really Thought Of Her ‘Titanic’ Performance</a></span></p><p>But how much was Winslet paid for her classic role as Rose DeWitt Bukater? Read on to find out!</p><h2 id=winslet-39-s-career-hadn-39-t-really-begun-prior-to-titanic><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Winslet's Career Hadn't Really Begun Prior To Titanic</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before achieving superstardom in her role as Rose, Kate Winslet wasn't earning very much money at all. Her first big break came when playing Juliet Hulme in the Peter Jackson psychological drama Heavenly Creatures. But even after this, Kate was still working normal jobs - she actually worked in a London delicatessen slicing ham and cheeses. It was only after starring in Titanic that her fortunes really began to change.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Leonardo DiCaprio Did With His 'Titanic' Salary</a></span></p><h2 id=casting-winslet-was-a-big-leap-of-faith-for-james-cameron><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Casting Winslet Was A Big Leap Of Faith For James Cameron</span></h2><p>Casting Winslet in the leading role for a $200 million project was something even the actress herself has acknowledged as a big risk. But director James Cameron definitely saw potential in the young star. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with USA Today</a>, Winslet said "James [Cameron] took a risk in casting me. A lot of my contemporaries — Uma Thurman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder — were much more likely candidates. I got lucky."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Revolutionary Road actress had petitioned hard for the role, however, and was determined to get the part: "I closed the script, wept floods of tears and said, 'Right, I've absolutely got to be a part of this. No two ways about it," she said.</p><h2 id=he-didn-39-t-regret-taking-the-chance-though><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Didn't Regret Taking The Chance, Though</span></h2><p>While he may have been reluctant initially, James Cameron certainly didn't have regrets about casting Winslet - who has been credited by both critics and fans of the movie alike for holding the production together, making the love story believable, compelling, and emotionally engaging.</p><p>In fact, Winslet's performance is so integral to Titanic's power that it is hard to imagine any other actress in the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-kate-do-with-her-earnings><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Did Kate Do With Her Earnings?</span></h2><p>With her biggest acting check to date deposited in the bank, what did the twenty-two-year old actress do with her earnings? Blow it all on a luxury cruise? Not so much. In fact, Kate was quite sensible with her money and used it to purchase her first home in the quaint village of Angarrack, Cornwall. The property cost just £200,000, and Kate went on to sell it three years later for a healthy profit.</p><p>Since then, the actress has gone on to invest her earnings in a variety of properties across the world, with several at home in the UK, and one particular penthouse in New York City's Chelsea neighbourhood. Kate certainly seems savvy with her money, and knows how to invest and grow her money wisely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-winslet-39-s-overall-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is Winslet's Overall Net Worth?</span></h2><p>Since appearing in Titanic, Winslet has gone on to amass an enormous fortune. Starring in high grossing movies such as The Holiday, Finding Neverland, and Revolutionary Road have meant the star can command large fees for her performances - and the pay checks certainly start to rack up. Her acting fees, in addition to her advertising work and other ventures, all contribute to a very sizeable amount. Sources say Winslet is worth an astonishing $65 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How 'Titanic' Affected James Cameron's Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=so-how-much-did-kate-make-for-titanic><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>So How Much Did Kate Make For Titanic?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When considering Winslet's fee for the film, you have to remember that she was a relatively unknown actress at this point, so was not in a position to be commanding a large fee for her work. Nonetheless, the actress received a considerable sum for her part in the movie - a whopping $2 million. That's right, two million dollars. Kate definitely earned her money - she worked long hours, spent considerable time in freezing cold water on set (developing a bad case of pneumonia), and even narrowly avoided drowning during filming! Kate was willing to put herself through a lot of pain to make the movie a success, and she was compensated well!</p><p>Though Kate earned big bucks for her role, she didn't get as big a pay check as her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. More established at this time, Leo received a staggering $2.5 million for his work as loveable rogue Jack Dawson. His greater experience in the industry and box office draw most likely allowed him to negotiate this higher fee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>James Cameron Said No To This Oscar Winner For Titanic</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lm5bBpnnWoqWspJWpeq6typ5kn6eiYsGqwMCnoJxlnJq8r63RnaZmnJmYrrG%2ByKhko5mdmsBur8CmnKunnmQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-did-kate-winslet-make-for-titanic-leonardo-dicaprio-james-cameron.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-much-did-kate-winslet-make-for-titanic-leonardo-dicaprio-james-cameron.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-did-kate-winslet-make-for-titanic-leonardo-dicaprio-james-cameron.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-much-did-kate-winslet-make-for-titanic-leonardo-dicaprio-james-cameron.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-did-kate-winslet-make-for-titanic-leonardo-dicaprio-james-cameron.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-kate-winslet-make-for-titanic-leonardo-dicaprio-james-cameron.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-don-adams-make-latest-don-adams-net-worth-income-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-don-adams-make-latest-don-adams-net-worth-income-salary.html>How Much Money Does Don Adams Make?
