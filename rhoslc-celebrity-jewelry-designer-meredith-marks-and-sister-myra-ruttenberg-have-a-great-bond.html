<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” actress Meredith Marks and her sister Myra Ruttenberg have a very close relationship. Her sister is an advocate for those with mental illnesses.</p><p>Meredith is not just a wife and mother but also an extremely devoted sister who frequently goes out of her way to help out with her sister’s endeavors.</p><p>To go past how upset she was by a friend’s obscene outburst, Meredith sticks with her new pals and puts the past behind her. Even though the group is becoming increasingly fractious, Meredith is concentrating on what matters to her by staging a fashion show with her sister to promote mental health awareness.</p><p>Her Instagram postings demonstrate how frequently the two sisters spend time together in opulent settings. People are interested to learn about her sister, who is just as beautiful as Meredith, in light of this.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts></span>Quick Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full name</strong></td><td>Meredith Marks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Jewelry Designer & Reality TV Star</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>December 15, 1972</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>50 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Chicago, United States</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Seth Marks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sister</strong></td><td>Myra Ruttenberg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother</strong></td><td>Gloria Kaufman</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-meredith-marks-sister-meet-myra-ruttenberg></span>Who Is Meredith Marks Sister? Meet Myra Ruttenberg<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Myra Ruttenberg is the sister of Meredith Marks. Both of the sister sisters have a close relationship and frequently work together to aid others.</p><p>Myra has always had a keen insight into how others think and feel. Myra achieved success as a business owner and event coordinator after earning her degree from the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California.</p><p>She used her people skills in her profession to negotiate her clients’ emotional demands while emphasizing attention to detail. Meredith and Myra were affected by their parent’s divorce as children, and Myra later helped her children through this adjustment.</p><figure></figure><p>She is aware of how difficult this shift may be for all parties, not just grownups. She discovered how alone it could feel after experiencing the aftereffects of addiction and mental health issues with her son. She saw her son’s use of drugs as self-medication during this period as a cry for assistance.</p><p>She frequently received incorrect information and was misled as she searched for a suitable facility. Myra Ruttenberg, Marks’ sister, founded the ADR Foundation nonprofit to help other families deal with the emotionally taxing and occasionally expensive healing process.</p><p>Myra wants to ensure those in need don’t get stuck without the services they need by establishing the ADR Foundation for Mental Health & Addiction to supply them. She is aware of the importance of these programs, given the dangerous nature of addiction and mental health issues.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=meredith-marks-nephew-is-also-into-charity-works></span>Meredith Marks Nephew Is Also Into Charity Works<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Alex is the son of Meredith Marks’ sister. Alex’s battle with addiction and mental health made him want to help others. As per his bio on the website of the ADR Foundation, he started using drugs at a young age because he was constantly empty and bored.</p><p>You pick up where you left off with addiction, as many individuals have said. For Alex, things grew worse every time he relapsed after leaving treatment.</p><p>After attempting suicide, he was prepared for change. He recognized the need to maintain cleanliness and was prepared to listen after suffering an enlarged left ventricle, among other health issues. He decided to attend a dual diagnosis institution in Los Angeles as an investment in his future.</p><figure></figure><p>There, he discovered a variety of coping mechanisms and learned how to appreciate life without using intoxicants. Alex was motivated to help others and give back due to this life experience. Alex wouldn’t be here today if no one had taken the time to dedicate himself and his recuperation.</p><p>Marks shares a narrative of her nephew Alex Ruttenberg’s experience with substance misuse that coincided with his mental health difficulties because she now feels confident enough to speak up for people experiencing internal struggles.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;Page Six, Marks praised her nephew Alex and remarked, “Seeing Alex thriving today is clearly a massive positive.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=meredith-marks-is-a-mother-to-three-children></span>Meredith Marks Is A Mother To Three Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Seth Marks and Meredith Marks were wed for a considerable amount of time. They have three children together as a result of their 25-year marriage.</p><p>Three of Meredith Marks’ children, Brooks, Reid, and Chloe, have previously been introduced to fans. Because several of her children have appeared on RHOSLC, fans are familiar with them.</p><p>The oldest of the three children is Reid. He is rumored to work and reside in New York. It isn’t easy to know what he does daily because his Instagram account is hidden.</p><p>Although Brooks, her son who designs tracksuits, receives a lot of screen time, Chloe is rarely present, and Reid hasn’t been introduced. Meredith visited the Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen Clubhouse on November 2 and brought a delightful surprise: Chloe, her daughter, worked as a bartender.</p><figure></figure><p>Chloe most likely fled the house as well, just like Reid did. She routinely posts updates on Instagram about her most recent experiences with friends. She has so far appeared on the episode “Everybody Needs a Switzerland” of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.</p><p>Since Brooks’ appearance in Season 1 of The Real Housewives from Salt Lake City, he has acquired a lot of followers. The ambitious fashion designer swiftly rose to the top of the cast of the program.</p><p>Brooks may have chosen to postpone attending school to concentrate on expanding his fashion company and support Meredith and Seth while they decide what’s best for them.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-meredith-marks-parents></span>Meet Meredith Marks Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The reality television actress was reared in the lovely American city of Chicago by her father and mother, Gloria Kaufman, who are both American citizens.</p><p>In February 2021, her father passed away. She gave the Alzheimer’s Association of Chicago a week’s worth of sales revenue from the Meredith Marks store in honor of her late father.</p><p>She claimed to be Jewish at her baptism on December 15. She has been close with her parents ever since she was a baby. She enjoyed producing jewelry as well after admiring her great-antique grandmother’s pieces.</p><p>Meredith was captivated by a 40-carat aquamarine gemstone with a rich color that her great-grandmother had spent years looking for and had eventually set in a diamond-studded cocktail ring.</p><p>She spent her early years seeing her mother get dressed and experiment with numerous flashy accessories. Her mother’s Marina B earrings, which had interchangeable gemstones at the bottom, ignited her passion for jewelry.</p><p>Meredith’s fascination with the Marina B earrings later served as the impetus for her own collections of functional and adaptable pieces.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-meredith-marks-so-rich></span>How is Meredith Marks so rich?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Meredith’s lucrative, eponymous high-end jewelry and accessories business is the source of her wealth.
