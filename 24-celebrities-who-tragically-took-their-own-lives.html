A lot of us go through difficult times when we feel depressed, but we don't have to deal with&nbsp;our every move being monitored under a microscope.</p><p>Celebrity suicides shock the rest of the public because to us they are iconic figures who are&nbsp;rich and successful and therefore must be happy. Many of them have had struggles with depression or other mental disorders that were left untreated or ignored until it was too late.</p><h2 id=24-robin-williams---age-63><strong>24. Robin Williams - Age 63</strong></h2><p>Perhaps one of the most recent and shocking suicides to rock Hollywood, actor and comedian <a href=#>Robin Williams</a> hung himself in 2014. It was revealed that the actor had been silently struggling with Parkinson’s Disease, dementia, and depression. Comedians are often the most tragic figures of all - living their lives in secret darkness while the world saw an entertaining, inspiring, and moving actor that many looked up to. Williams' death hit close to home with <a href=#>a lot of celebrities.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=23-dave-mirra---age-41><strong>23.

Sawyer Sweeten - Age 19</strong></h2><p>Sweeten is known for his childhood role on the show Everybody Loves Raymond. Family and friends were left shocked when the actor took his life last spring, 2015, by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. Those closest to him said that Sweeten was concerned with money troubles, his fading career, and was being bullied over gay rumors. Sweeten left behind a <a href=#>twin brother.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=21-gia-allemand---age-29><strong>21.

Gia was found and rushed to the hospital, but she was later declared brain dead and removed from life support two days following.</p><p>The reality star was rumored to be having relationship issues with boyfriend, NBA baller, Ryan Anderson.

The two had been fighting the day she died, Gia told Anderson that she still loved him.&nbsp;Anderson dropped Allemand off at her apartment at around 6 p.m. after running errands and told her, "I don't love you anymore," <a href=#>according to the report that was written.</a></p><p></p><h2 id=25-jovan-belcher---age-25><strong>25. Jovan Belcher - Age 25</strong></h2><p>This pro-footballer was all over the news when he shot his longtime girlfriend, Kassandra Perkins, nine times in front of his mother. The Kansas City Chief’s linebacker then drove to the Chief’s practice facility where he shot himself in front of his coach and manager. Witnesses say right before his death Belcher said, “I wasn’t able to get enough help.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His post-mortem autopsy showed evidence that the athlete was suffering from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) caused by his repeated head injuries from playing football. CTE is known to cause aggression, confusion, depression, and memory loss. Sadly, the deaths of Jovan and Kassandra left their young daughter orphaned.</p><p></p><h2 id=19-lex-mcallister---age-31><strong>19. Lex McAllister - Age 31</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, here is another Bachelor contestant on the list. What is this show doing to these women?

She had men wrapped around her finger, but those close to her said that the star had “severe fears and frequent depressions” as well as, “abrupt and unpredictable mood changes.” This suggests that the actress may have been suffering from mental illness which could have led to her decision to take her own life.</p><p></p><h2 id=17-mindy-mccready---age-37><strong>17. Mindy McCready - Age 37</strong></h2><p>McCready was a well-known country singer in the 2000s. The singer took her own life in 2013 at her home in Arkansas by shooting herself in the head with a gun. It is rumored that Mindy had previously attempted suicide twice prior to this.</p><p>One month prior to her death, Mindy’s former boyfriend and father of one of her sons shot himself on the same porch that Mindy did.</p><p></p><h2 id=16-simone-battle---age-25><strong>16.

Shakir Stewart - Age 34</strong></h2><p>This is the man behind the great Rick Ross, Young Jeezy, and many other artists signed to Def Jam Records. Stewart was found dead in his bathroom from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. People close to him said that in the weeks before his death, he had been acting strange and sporadic, but there was nothing more they could do, as Shakir took his life shortly after people began recognizing the warning signs.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-wendy-o-williams---age-48><strong>13. Wendy O. Williams - Age 48</strong></h2><p>Williams was the lead singer of the punk band the Plasmatics. The band had a cult following in the '90s and was the definition of grunge. Williams' use of sledgehammers bashing guitars, violence, sexuality and nudity ultimately led to <a href=#>Williams' nickname</a>, "The Queen of Shock."</p><p>Wendy fatally shot herself in the head in 1998 in the woods by her home in Connecticut. The punk rocker apparently tried to kill herself once before, lodging a knife in her chest.</p><p>Friends and family close to Williams said that she&nbsp;had found it difficult to live a normal life past her peak and had been disconsolate for a long time.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-alexander-mcqueen---age-40><strong>12. Alexander McQueen - Age 40</strong></h2><p>The world renowned British fashion designer took his life in 2010 a little over a week after he lost his mother, Joyce, to cancer.

Although apparently the designer had originally planned to shoot himself on the runway during one of his live catwalk shows.&nbsp;McQueen’s legacy still lives on today through his fashion and influence in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=11-lucy-gordon---age-28><strong>11.
