That said, fans also know that the brand has done amazing TV work, too. Not only is Marvel <a href=#>upping the game with their new shows</a>, but they're also <a href=#>bringing back hits from yesteryear</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On ABC, the MCU was building up a solid line-up, led by Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. During this time, the franchise was crafting a show called Most Wanted, but it never made it to air.</p><p>Let's look back and see what happened to this announced spin-off.</p><h2 id=marvel-has-a-unique-tv-history>Marvel Has A Unique TV History</h2><p>To say that Marvel has had an interesting time on television would be a major understatement. It would take a considerable amount of time to go through its entire history, but even looking at its most recent offerings will reveal some huge hits and misses for the massive franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On ABC and on Netflix, Marvel has offered shows that are on now interconnected within the MCU. Shows like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Daredevil, and Jessica Jones have all been wild successes. Contrasting this, however, our shows like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inhumans</a> and Iron Fist, which most people would rather forget about entirely.</p><p>Last year, Disney+ started airing original Marvel content, and their offerings have been good, for the most part. People have enjoyed shows like Loki and WandaVision, though they have had complaints about other projects.</p><p>The ABC shows appear to be considered canon, meaning that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., one of Marvel's best shows, has a deeper MCU connection. This is great for fans, considering the show was a huge hit. In fact, during its run on ABC, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D was successful enough to get a proposed spin-off project.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Natalie Portman Is Showing A New Side Of Herself In 'Thor: Love And Thunder'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-most-wanted-39-was-an-39-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-39-spin-off>'Most Wanted' Was An 'Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.' Spin-Off</h2><p>Years back, it was announced that Marvel's Most Wanted was going to be a brand new spin-off show on ABC. People had already gotten familiar with the characters on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, and that show was going to utilize a backdoor pilot to get things rolling for Most Wanted.</p><p>According to the show's logline, "Two ex-spies and ex-spouses who are on the run with no friends, no S.H.I.E.L.D. and a long list of enemies looking to claim a bounty on their heads. Able to trust no one but each other, Bobbi and Hunter form an uneasy alliance with Dominic Fortune, a rogue adventurer with a wealth of resources and even more adversaries, who agrees to protect them so long as they help him with his own agenda. These two heroes will help anyone in need, all while trying to uncover the conspiracy that put their own lives in jeopardy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you can imagine, there was a lot of hype for Most Wanted to get off the ground. It was going to touch on characters that people already liked, and it was going to add an entirely new wrinkle into the small screen work that Marvel was putting together.</p><p>Sadly, this project never aired a single episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Overhyped 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' Will Live On To Destroy Future MCU Films</a></span></p><h2 id=most-wanted-never-aired>Most Wanted Never Aired</h2><p>So, why was Most Wanted scrapped before it ever saw the light of day? Sadly, this show just wasn't on the same level as what came before it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Most<strong> </strong>Wanted, ultimately at the end of the day, did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked about it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want to figure out what the next show is that we do together, is something that we all feel is as creatively strong as it can be," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said ABC executive, Channing Dungey</a>.</p><p>For those that poured their heart and soul into the project, this had to be a tough pill to swallow. While it is unreasonable to think that every project will become a success on the small screen, knowing that this show wasn't even good enough to air a single episode is pretty brutal news, for even the most seasoned veterans to take.</p><p>Though Most Wanted never hit the small screen, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. continued to be a popular show on the network. Fans were pretty bummed when it officially ended, but the show was at least on the air.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Connelly Voicing Spider-Man's Suit In 'Homecoming' Was Intentionally "Meta," Says Marvel</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most Wanted had a lot of potential, but at the end of the day, it wasn't strong enough to get made. Considering that this is the same network that okayed Inhumans, then maybe we're better off having never seen it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This 'Ms. Marvel' Star Has Been Playing Doctor Strange For Years â€“ In Another Language</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDHnmSmm6ViwKm71makmqqmmrm0ecyoqq1lp5a7tbHDaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-mcu-show-marvels-most-wanted.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-mcu-show-marvels-most-wanted.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-mcu-show-marvels-most-wanted.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-mcu-show-marvels-most-wanted.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-mcu-show-marvels-most-wanted.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-mcu-show-marvels-most-wanted.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-two-and-a-half-men-star-angus-t-jones-net-worth-today.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-two-and-a-half-men-star-angus-t-jones-net-worth-today.html>What Is 'Two And A Half Men' Star Angus T.
