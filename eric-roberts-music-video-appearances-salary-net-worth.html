He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his film debut, King of the Gypsies (1978) and nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in Runaway Train (1985). His career slowed down in the following decade, however, as his sister <a href=#>Julia Roberts surpassed him</a> in fame.</p><p>Roberts' career may have waned during the 1990s, but the actor managed to rebound and amass a sizable net worth due to his work in an unlikely medium: music videos. He became a music video heavyweight during the 21st century, and his massive earnings may surprise even the most die-hard fans.</p><h2 id=eric-roberts-credits-music-video-roles-with-restoring-his-2-million-net-worth>Eric Roberts Credits Music Video Roles With Restoring His $2 Million Net Worth</h2><p>Eric Roberts was a sought-after actor for many years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a Vanity Fair profile</a>, however, the actor's drug addiction derailed his career, and led to him getting arrested for cocaine possession in 1987. He didn't spend time in prison, but he received far fewer roles, and eventually found himself struggling to pay the bills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eric-roberts-film-premiere.jpg><p>Roberts began taking supporting roles in less-than-stellar films, but things really turned around for him in 2004, when he made the pivot to high-profile roles in popular music videos. The first video he appeared in was "Mr. Brightside" by The Killers, and the success of the video led to Roberts becoming a sought-after name for the second time.</p><p>There have been conflicting reports of <strong>Roberts' rate per day</strong>, with most estimates being placed between $3,600 to $5K, but given the pedigree of the artists that he's worked with, it's safe to assume that he earned even more from his eight music video appearances:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Music Video</p></td><td><p>Artist</p></td><td><p>Year</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Mr. Brightside"</p></td><td><p>The Killers</p></td><td><p>2004</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"It's Like That"</p></td><td><p>Mariah Carey</p></td><td><p>2005</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"We Belong Together"</p></td><td><p>Mariah Carey</p></td><td><p>2005</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Hey You"</p></td><td><p>Godhead</p></td><td><p>2006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Smack That"</p></td><td><p>Akon & Eminem</p></td><td><p>2006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Miss Atomic Bomb"</p></td><td><p>The Killers</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"The Black Veil"</p></td><td><p>Angelica Agurbash</p></td><td><p>2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"B**ch Better Have My Money"</p></td><td><p>Rihanna</p></td><td><p>2015</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The music videos proved excellent for business.

So I was like a lucky charm for a while. I got a whole new audience."</p><p>Roberts wasn't kidding when it came to being a "lucky charm."
