<time>05 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Bader Shammas recently made headlines following the announcement of his engagement to the former Disney Channel and feature film star, <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>, on November 28th of this year.</p><p>The Mean Girls and Freaky Friday alum announced the <a href=#>news</a> via Instagram, captioning a photo of herself and Shammas – where she sported her new Harry Winston ring estimated at around $250,000 – with: “My love. My life. My family. My future. @bader.shammas #love.”</p><p>The couple has kept their two-year relationship reasonably quiet, with Shammas’ private social media accounts and Lohan’s relative silence making it challenging to pinpoint the exact timings of the relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>There was much speculation about Lohan’s personal life following her move to the Emirates in 2018, making Shammas’ first sighting an exciting affair for fans of the actress.&nbsp;</p><p>Lohan’s now-fiancé was first seen on social media in a group photo shared via Instagram that was later deleted in February of 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Bader Shammas?</h2><p>Fans were quick to learn all they could about the man Lohan has described as her “future.” Details online are sparse as Shammas has protected his own privacy to the best of his abilities. Still, some eagle-eyed users have gathered as much information about him as they possibly can.</p><p>As per his Linkedin account, Shammas is currently the acting assistant vice-principal of Credit Suisse, one of the world’s leading global investment banks.&nbsp;</p><p>Not much is known about Shammas beyond his educational and professional credentials. Having obtained degrees from both the University of South Florida and the University of Tampa (where he received a Bachelors in Science in Finance from the latter), Shammas had worked in Wealth Management as part of &nbsp;BNP Paribas Corporate Institutional Banking in Kuwait and the UAE prior to residing in Dubai.&nbsp;</p><p>He has been at Credit Suisse since 2018, and his three-year posting there indicates that his lifestyle and substantial earnings have made the 34/35-year-old the ideal Beau for the actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Is His Net Worth?</h2><p>It is estimated that Shammas’ net worth is approximately $3-5 million, based on estimates that presidents of companies such as Credit Suisse make anything between $75,000 and $175,000 per year. Despite the ambiguity surrounding his exact net worth, it’s safe to say that Shammas is comfortable enough to drop a substantial amount on the perfect ring for Lohan.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>His Relationship With Lohan</h2><p>As far as his personal life goes, the couples’ privacy makes it difficult to gauge the exact timings and goings-on of the relationship.</p><p>After her move to Dubai, Lohan told Howard Stern in 2019 that she wanted to be with someone who was as low-key as she wanted to be, saying:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I want to date a guy that’s a businessman — doesn’t have Instagram, doesn’t have social media, and is completely off the grid in terms of that kind of stuff.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bader-Shammas-with-Linday-Lohan-683x1024.jpg><p>It seems as though Lohan got what she desired, a financier who prefers to stay off Instagram and avoid as much of the limelight as possible. The only indication that the two have been going strong for the past few years was the deleted Instagram post, and now the engagement announcement – both of which were shared on Lohan’s own terms.&nbsp;</p><p>Her desire to stay under the radar is understandable, considering her early career was plagued with scandal. From drugs to failed relationships, the former child actress could not seem to catch a break until her decision to leave the United States, a move she has consistently said to have been the best decision she ever made.&nbsp;</p><p>Lohan has been engaged once before to Russian business heir Egor Tarabasov. The two split in 2017, and Lohan has since stated that Tarabasov was physically abusive. He, however, vehemently denied this and declared it a “smear campaign” against him and his family.</p><p>Thankfully for Lohan, Bader Shammas appears to be the perfect partner. Having been spotted with his fiancée’s siblings, it’s clear her family considers him to be the ideal match. According to Page Six, Lohan’s father, Michael, stated:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“She’s relaunching her career and you want a good person in your life when you hit that restart button […] Everyone’s happy. Lindsay got her life back when she met him, she’s been living a really happy and healthy life”.</strong></p><p><strong>Her mother Dina has gone on record saying that she is happy to welcome Shammas into the family and that there is nothing a mother could want more than “than to see your children happy and loved”.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Shammas is reported to be traveling with Lohan as she reignites her acting career, having been spotted in Utah as she films her latest Netflix holiday film titled ‘Christmas in Wonderland that is due to be released at the end of 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Any Details About The Wedding?</h2><p>Shammas’ family is reported to be part of Kuwait’s first Christian families, with his allegedly originating from Turkey. Based on family sources, the Catholic Lohan is said to marry Shammas in a Church. Wherever the wedding occurs, it is guaranteed that it will be a private yet decadent event.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of Lohan’s fans are excited to see whether or not she shares details of the event, with most hoping for a glimpse of the dress she chooses to pair with the six-carat Winston ring.</p><p>Based on all the ups and downs of her previous romantic entanglements, fans are hopeful that Lohan has finally found the peace and love she has been craving since her early days in the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p>As of right now, the happy couple resides in Dubai, and it seems they plan to stay there as Lohan slowly rejoins the US film industry. She herself claimed that she hasn’t gone back to Los Angeles in nearly a decade and currently has no plans of moving back there any time soon.&nbsp;</p><p>After analyzing the engagement post, Lohan’s followers have deduced that Shammas popped the question outside of the UAE, seemingly on vacation somewhere much colder. Neither has publicly discussed when or where the wedding will take place.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCuwJ2cq2Wjna6uucCsZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbader-shammas-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbader-shammas-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbader-shammas-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbader-shammas-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbader-shammas-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbader-shammas-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./whitney-thore-net-worth-how-rich-is-the-star-of-my-big-fat-fabulous-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./whitney-thore-net-worth-how-rich-is-the-star-of-my-big-fat-fabulous-life.html>Whitney Thore Net Worth: How Rich is the Star of My Big Fat Fabulous Life?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-did-gregg-giannotti-say-boomer-esiason-walks-off-set-as-radio-host-slams-caller-in-mental-health-tirade-592186-html.html>What did Gregg Giannotti say?
