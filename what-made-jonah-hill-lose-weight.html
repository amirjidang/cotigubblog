Fans who have met him have also revealed that the actor is often nice in person, further evidenced by the <a href=#>long list of close friends he has in Hollywood.</a> Over the years, Jonah has opened up about being weight-shamed when he was younger, during high school, and even during his first years in Hollywood. His weight has fluctuated since the beginning of his career, with the dedicated actor gaining and <a href=#>losing weight for different acting projects.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, he’s transformed into a healthier version of himself since he first rose to fame in 2007. His dramatic weight loss has impressed fans and the media alike, but does it outweigh the damage that was done when Jonah was shamed for his body size? And how did he pull off such an inspiring transformation? Read on to find out!</p><h2 id=how-did-jonah-hill-lose-weight>How Did Jonah Hill Lose Weight?</h2><p>Jonah Hill’s first leading role came in Judd Apatow’s Superbad, which was released in 2007. Through Superbad and Jonah’s other roles from the mid to late 2000s, he cemented himself as a talented comedic actor.</p><p>By 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah was sporting a noticeably thinner figure</a>, prompting fans to wonder what the secret behind his weight loss was.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Leonardo DiCaprio And Jonah Hill Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mirror reports that when Jonah was first photographed looking thinner, he was traveling from a workout session with a personal trainer. So an exercise routine is presumably one factor that led to his weight loss, but the actor revealed that other things also contributed to his new healthier figure.</p><p>Jonah first began losing weight in 2011, explaining that he had changed his diet.</p><p>“I wish there was some crazy thing that I did, like a pill or a genie or something, but I went to see a nutritionist, and he told me what to eat to change my habits and stuff,” Jonah admitted in an interview cited by The Mirror, adding that Japanese food had been helpful in changing his diet.</p><p>The actor also explained that not drinking beer leads him to significant weight loss. But when he drinks even small amounts of beer, his weight loss is hindered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Think Meeting Jonah Hill Is Underwhelming</a></span></p><p>The publication also reports that Jonah sometimes sends his food diary to his nutritionist, which helps him stay on track with eating the right foods. Hilariously, the actor admitted that he once accidentally sent his food diary to Drake instead of the doctor. And unsurprisingly, he didn’t receive a reply!</p><p>It was a combination of changing his eating habits, educating himself about nutrition, and incorporating an exercise routine into his lifestyle that <a href=#>helped Jonah to totally transform his look and health.</a></p><h2 id=how-does-jonah-hill-feel-about-his-weight-loss>How Does Jonah Hill Feel About His Weight Loss?</h2><p>Fans have praised Jonah Hill for losing a significant amount of weight and improving his health. But the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actor revealed on The View that he has struggled with being weight-shamed in the past.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Women, first of all, have it way harder than I’ll ever have it in my entire career or life. Right?” he opened up to the View hosts, explaining that he believes everyone has a snapshot of themselves that they try to hide from the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Think This Is Jonah Hill's Most Meaningful Tattoo</a></span></p><p>“And no matter where you go, you keep the snapshot with you,” he went on, alluding to the fact that it’s been difficult for him to shed the image he held of himself when he was younger and shamed for his weight, even though he’s lost weight now.</p><p>“I became famous in my late teens and I spent most of my young adult life listening to people say that I was fat and gross and unattractive,” read the words in a manifesto Jonah had written for a magazine in which he conducted interviews with other stars who felt that they were also carrying around a hidden “snapshot” of their younger selves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn’t until Jonah reached adulthood that he realized how much the weight shaming actually impacted him. In his interview with The View, he admitted that he hasn’t “figured out” how to completely practice self-love and self-acceptance yet but it is a long-lasting journey for him.</p><p>He has also realized that being less hard on himself about his appearance is a commitment that he recognizes as being important to him, even if he’s not where he wants to be with that yet.</p><h2 id=why-did-jonah-hill-gain-weight-back>Why Did Jonah Hill Gain Weight Back?</h2><p>Since first losing weight, Jonah has gained weight back for different acting projects. Men's Journal revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he gained weight again for the movie War Dogs in 2016</a>, for which he put on 40 lbs to play arms dealer Efraim Diveroli.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After doing the film, he wanted to lose weight again, and on Channing Tatum’s advice, started eating less and visiting a trainer.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's Why Jonah Hill Passed On A Role In 'The Hangover'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrqisMRmoaimkZ16qbXLpWSlp6OaerixyKCfrWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-made-jonah-hill-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-made-jonah-hill-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-made-jonah-hill-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-made-jonah-hill-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-made-jonah-hill-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-made-jonah-hill-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./they-got-him-on-4k-andrew-tate-wiretap-confessions-go-viral-takes-internet-by-storm-535740-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./they-got-him-on-4k-andrew-tate-wiretap-confessions-go-viral-takes-internet-by-storm-535740-html.html>They got him on 4K: Andrew Tate wiretap confessions go viral, takes internet by storm</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-most-expensive-buffets-in-the-world.html>The Most Expensive Buffets In The World, As Of 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-most-expensive-buffets-in-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
