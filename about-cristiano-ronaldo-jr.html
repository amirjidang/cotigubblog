<time>13 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cristiano-ronaldo-jr.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Famous as the eldest son of Portuguese football superstar <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. has already revealed fantastic football skills and has repeatedly shown his rich heritage in the media spotlight.</p><p>Previously he joined the Club de Fútbol Pozuelo de Alarcón – a small football club in Madrid, Spain, where he has been playing since 2016.</p><p>Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. is very close to his father, and he is always present in most of his posts on social media platforms. He often goes to the stadium with him and many of the award ceremonies.&nbsp;</p><p>Most notable among his trips with his father is the FIFA Ballon d’Or 2013, which he visited with his father and his then-girlfriend, Russian supermodel Irina Shayk.&nbsp;</p><p>The budding star also posed with football legends like Diego Maradona and Pele from Brazil.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Old Is Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.?</h2><p>The young soccer star was born on June 17, 2010. As of 2022, he will be 12 in June. His birth announcement was made the same year on July 3, through his father’s Facebook account and Twitter handle.</p><p>To this day, there has been much speculation about the possible Identity of the younger Ronaldo’s mother, but of what is obvious, no conclusive evidence has been found.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family Facts</h2><p>Cristiano Ronaldo jr. lives in Spain with his father, his father’s current girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez. Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.’s Grandparents are Jose Dinis Aveiro and Maria Dolores. He has a couple of aunts – Liliana and Elma and an uncle named Hugo. Recently his father became father to twins Mateo and Eva; according to football legend, his first son wants six siblings to match his magical CR7 brand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rise To Fame</h2><p>A direct descendant of his fame as a Portuguese football legend is more than enough. Still, it is not only thanks to his father that Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. has attracted so much media attention lately.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2017, his father released a video featuring the young talent imitating his father’s famous pose on free kicks and scoring an incredible goal.</p><p>In June 2017, a short video showing his remarkable ability with the ball attracted worldwide media attention and was virally spread on social media. When Real Madrid players gathered at the Santiago-Bernabéu Stadium to celebrate their 4-1 victory over Juventus in the Champions League in Wales, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. and a few other kids started playing with the ball.&nbsp;</p><p>A Real Madrid fan managed to record a 20-second video of the moment when the prodigy in the club’s purple away jersey dribbled two older children in the penalty area, hit them both with an amazing pirouette, and finally, dribbled past the goalkeeper and kicked the ball straight into the net.&nbsp;</p><p>Thousands of fans present were captivated by this moment, and the video was shown in several news media and attracted a large number of viewers on the Internet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mother’s Identity</h2><p>The identity of the woman who gave birth to Cristiano Ronaldo’s son has been a significant source of rumor and controversy since the football star’s paternity announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>When his former girlfriend Irina Shayk was removed from the list of possible mothers, it was revealed that Ronaldo was allegedly involved in a one-night stand with a waitress during his time at Manchester United.</p><p>When the waitress realized that she was pregnant, she contacted the famous footballer with the news and ordered a DNA test that confirmed that the baby was Ronaldo’s.</p><p>The soccer icon decided to take full responsibility for his child, as abortion was impossible because the waitress was of the Catholic faith.</p><p>Sometime later, rumors began to spread that Ronaldo bought the woman’s silence with the sum of $10 million, giving him full custody of the boy, and the waitress was advised not to try to contact the boy in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>According to recent rumors, the woman is currently a student in the UK and is desperate to contact her son despite her agreement with the father.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Future As A Football Player</h2><p>Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. Is Now at the Manchester United football academy.</p><p>The young soccer athlete is currently at the Manchester United football academy alongside Wayne Rooney’s son, Kai, and Nemanja Matic’s son.&nbsp;</p><p>He joined the English club’s Under-12 squad during the summer transfer in 2021. He previously played in the Juventus football academy and transferred to the Red Devils side after his father returned to Old Trafford in a £20 million transfer in August 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The Portuguese forward revealed in the past that he would love to see his son follow in his footsteps. The boy’s grandmother, Maria Dolores, believes he is more skilled than his father at that age and is hopeful he will be a great player. Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.’s Man Utd move ensured that he was closer to his dad, his mentor.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>The upcoming soccer athlete is already doing well in the globally celebrated sport.
