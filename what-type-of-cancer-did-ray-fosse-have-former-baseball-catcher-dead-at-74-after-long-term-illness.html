In fact, Carol was a major help in Ray fighting cancer silently.</p><p>Talking about his health condition earlier this year, Fosse mentioned that he and his wife had been fighting the disease for 16 years which gives the idea of how supporting his wife is.</p><p>Besides, any professional or early age details of Ray’s wife Carol are yet to be explored.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-was-ray-fosse-net-worth></span>What Was Ray Fosse Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ray Fosse is believed to have left behind a decent net worth of around $10- $20 million, considering his career.</p><p>Although a couple of sources have mentioned his net worth, the figure in each of them varies significantly.</p><p>On the other hand, the official sources have not yet confirmed the actual net worth value of the late baseball player and broadcaster.</p><p>Hence, the above-mentioned figure is only an estimation considering Fosse’s playing as well as commentating career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ray-fosse-death-cause-how-did-he-die></span>Ray Fosse Death Cause: How Did He Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The former MLB player and commentator Ray Fosse reportedly dies after his 16 years-long battle against cancer.</p><p>The actual cause of death of Fosse is his cancer which is also mentioned in his&nbsp;Wikipedia&nbsp;bio.
