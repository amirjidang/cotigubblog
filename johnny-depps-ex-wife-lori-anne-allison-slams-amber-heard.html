Though she did not mention her ex-husband’s name, Depp — who was married to the Aquaman star from 2015 to 2017 — filed<a href=#> a lawsuit against the actress</a> for defamation.</p><p>After a lengthy battle in court, during which both Heard and Depp testified and claimed the other was the abuser, in June 2022, a jury ordered the Justice League actress to <a href=#>pay her ex $10 million in compensatory damages</a> and $5 million in putative damages. Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages.</p><p>“I had met her before, I’d been to parties at his house. She seemed really nice and she was gorgeous, and what’s not to love?” Allison described her initial thoughts of Heard. “But as the time went by and I would hear things about her – she who shall not be named – he didn’t seem too happy all the time. I didn’t see him a lot so I can’t really say.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Johnny-Depps-Ex-Wife-Lori-Defends-Him-Slams-Amber-Heard-Inline-001.jpg><p>Despite not claiming to know the intimacies of her ex-husband’s romance with Heard, Allison was clear that she was no fan of the actress.</p><p>“I’m no angel — I’ve done my share of sh—tty things to people — but what she did was absolutely horrific,” the beauty guru said on Tuesday. “And if there were things I could do to her that were legal I would do them! I would.”</p><p>Though both Depp and Heard initially tried to appeal the verdict, <a href=#>the exes settled in December 2022</a>. “I defended my truth and in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed,” Heard wrote via social media after the settlement. “The vilification I have faced on social media is an amplified version of the ways in which women are [re-victimized] when they come forward. Now I finally have an opportunity to emancipate myself from something I attempted to leave over six years ago and on terms I can agree to. I have made no admission. This is not an act of concession. There are no restrictions or gags with respect to my voice moving forward.”</p><p>Depp, for his part, donated $1 million of his win to charities.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We are pleased to formally close the door on this painful chapter for Mr. Depp, who made clear throughout this process that his priority was about bringing the truth to light,” his attorneys <strong>Benjamin Chew</strong> and <strong>Camille Vazquez</strong> stated at the time. “The jury’s unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depp’s favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place.”</p><p>In addition to his marriages to Allison and Heard, the Sweeney Todd star was also in a longterm relationship with ex <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Paradis</strong></a>, with whom he shares daughter <a href=#><strong>Lily-Rose Depp</strong></a>, 23, and son Jack Depp.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5iju7p5w56nqatdmsVuw8ifnGakn6e2bq3Np5xmmZyhtrS7zWaqpZmdqHqiucGeqWaglZa%2FpXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohnny-depps-ex-wife-lori-anne-allison-slams-amber-heard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohnny-depps-ex-wife-lori-anne-allison-slams-amber-heard.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohnny-depps-ex-wife-lori-anne-allison-slams-amber-heard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohnny-depps-ex-wife-lori-anne-allison-slams-amber-heard.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohnny-depps-ex-wife-lori-anne-allison-slams-amber-heard.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohnny-depps-ex-wife-lori-anne-allison-slams-amber-heard.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./judge-reinhold-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./judge-reinhold-net-worth.html>Judge Reinhold Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jessica-oyelowo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88536-html.html>Jessica Oyelowo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jessica-oyelowo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88536-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
