The past few months the couple has been starring on the third season of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. All of the couples have had <a href=#>drama</a> this season, but Corey and Evelin seem to have the most. Between secretly getting married, Corey having an affair with a girl named Jenny, and then Corey lying about it to Evelin, they have definitely had a lot of dramatic and intense moments this season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Where '90 Day Fiance' Couple David and Annie Toborowsky Stand Today</a></span></p><p>Things have gotten so bad that they have gotten to the point where they're seriously considering <a href=#>divorce</a>. The couple is trying to work things out, but Corey's affair was the breaking point for Evelin and it doesn't seem like they have that much of a chance at making it. Let's take a look at all of the red flags that led up to this point in their relationship.</p><h2 id=corey-gave-evelin-40-000-when-they-were-still-dating><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Corey Gave Evelin $40,000 When They Were Still Dating</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first red flag was early on in Corey and Evelin’s relationship. When they were still dating long distance, Corey gave Evelin thousands of dollars and that’s not including the money he spent on travel. During an episode of 90 Day Fiancé, Corey explained how much he has spent on Evelin and said, “So far, I’ve given Evelin $30,000 to invest in properties for us, $6,000 for her car, as well as $2,000 to invest in a cocktail bar. In total, I’ve given Evelin $40,000.” It’s normal to help your partner financially sometimes, but $40,000 is a lot of money in that short amount of time. They weren’t even married yet when Evelin received all of that money from Corey.</p><h2 id=they-accused-each-other-of-cheating-before-they-got-engaged><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>They Accused Each Other Of Cheating Before They Got Engaged</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Corey and Evelin were still dating, they already had problems. Obviously couples fight sometimes, but when it involves cheating, it can tear the relationship apart. In fact, the couple briefly broke up because of cheating accusations. They also both saw other people when they were taking a break in their relationship. For instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey was seen with another 90 Day Fiancé star, Larissa Dos Santos Lima, after his breakup with Evelin</a>. It seems like neither one of them cheated on each other at that point in time, but they definitely had trust issues. Healthy relationships require trust. If you can’t trust your partner, the whole relationship can turn toxic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Larissa From '90 Day Fiance' Has Been Up To In 2021</a></span></p><h2 id=evelin-didn-rsquo-t-meet-corey-at-the-airport-when-he-moved-to-ecuador><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Evelin Didn’t Meet Corey At The Airport When He Moved To Ecuador</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Corey and Evelin were done dating long distance, Corey decided to move to Ecuador so they could be together. But she wasn’t excited about it like most people would be. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy</a>, “Evelin came to the U.S. on a vacation visa and stayed with Corey in Washington for six months, but was missing her home in Ecuador, so Corey decided to leave his life behind in the states and move to Engabao… Evelin also decided not to meet him at the airport when he flew in, and instead had him take a bus back to her little hometown, which didn’t sit well with viewers." If she was really excited about starting their life together, she would’ve at least met him at the airport. That’s a huge red flag when the person you love isn’t excited about moving in with you, especially when you move across the world for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-secretly-got-married><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>They Secretly Got Married</strong></span></h2><p>Even after the cheating accusations and trust issues, Corey and Evelin still got married. But they did it in secret. Corey wrote on Instagram, “We didn’t tell anyone because Evelin wasn’t ready for her family or anyone to know she had gotten married at that time. I respected her wishes. We decided to keep it a secret. The production team was not made aware of this because we had just finished filming our first season. At the time we were not in talks with filming again. So we didn’t feel obligated to inform them. It was a very private and special moment for us!” It’s great that it was still a special moment for them, but you know something’s not right when you can’t tell anybody you got married. Evelin didn’t want her family to know since they didn’t believe in divorce and she was worried she would end up divorcing Corey. It’s definitely a red flag if you think you’re going to divorce your spouse right after marrying them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=corey-cheated-on-evelin-while-they-took-a-break-a-few-months-after-they-got-married><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Corey Cheated On Evelin While They Took A Break (A Few Months After They Got Married)</strong></span></h2><p>It turns out Evelin had a reason not to trust Corey. He had an affair with a woman while he was away from her. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch Weekly</a>, “Shortly after they got married, the couple took a break in their relationship and Corey... met a woman named Jenny... Rumors got back to Evelin, but when she confronted Corey after he returned to their marital home in Ecuador right before the coronavirus lockdowns in March 2020, he told her it was only a fling. Despite their time apart, Evelin and Corey agreed to reconnect and work on their relationship.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiance': Jorge Nava's Lies To Anfisa Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=corey-lied-to-evelin-about-his-affair-with-jenny><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Corey Lied To Evelin About His Affair With Jenny</strong></span></h2><p>The decision to work on their relationship helped for a little while and it seemed like they were going to make it, but during this season of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, Corey revealed he lied to Evelin even when they were trying to work things out. On the show, Corey told Evelin’s friend, Raul, "It was serious, you know, like, she introduced me to her family. And we were gonna actually get a place together. But Evelin doesn't know any of that, she just thinks it's a one-night thing… I lied to Evelin when I told her I wasn't intimate with Jenny. I told Evelin that I did see a girl while I was in Peru, umm… I didn't tell her just how serious it was, I didn't tell her that we were in any kind of relationship.” Once Corey told Evelin the truth, she said she wanted to get a divorce. After a few days, Evelin decided to try couples therapy with Corey, but she still seems like she doesn’t really want to be with him anymore. Their relationship has turned out to be a toxic one with lies and cheating. But we’ll have to see if they have any chance of turning things around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How The ‘90 Day Fiance’ Couples Are Making Their Relationships Work Through The Pandemic</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydXZa5rXnRnptmnpyWtLR5wqipnrFdlrulecSvnKWhnmK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f90-day-fiance-all-red-flags-corey-and-evelin-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f90-day-fiance-all-red-flags-corey-and-evelin-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f90-day-fiance-all-red-flags-corey-and-evelin-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f90-day-fiance-all-red-flags-corey-and-evelin-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f90-day-fiance-all-red-flags-corey-and-evelin-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f90-day-fiance-all-red-flags-corey-and-evelin-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ana-garcia-martins-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-24837-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ana-garcia-martins-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-24837-html.html>Ana Garcia Martins Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./a-look-at-karyn-parsons-multi-faceted-career.html>A Look At Karyn Parsons' Multi-Faceted Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./a-look-at-karyn-parsons-multi-faceted-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
