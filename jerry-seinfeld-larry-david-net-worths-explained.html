It was a fact that has baffled some fans, especially when they compared the comedian’s wealth to that of <strong><a href=#>Larry David</a></strong>, who created the popular sitcom <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Seinfeld</strong></a> alongside him.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>The pair first connected</a> in the 1970s, when they were both working to cut their teeth within the world of stand-up comedy.

One of their biggest bones to pick was the belief that the pair landed similar contracts for residual income from syndication.</p><p>This view was expressed in a Reddit query, saying, “I think back in 1998 when the show ended their net worth was pretty close, But In the last 10 years Seinfeld has really pulled away big time . I just figured they both had the same syndication money deal. Is it because of those last two seasons?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The confusion even turned into disappointment in some quarters, with some arguing that Seinfeld had actually rode on David’s talent to his success. “Seinfeld was the ultimate lottery winner, his stand-up is dreadful but Larry David and that cast made him a billionaire,” a frustrated fan wrote on X.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Larry-David-and-Seinfeld-The-Contest.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Larry David Created The Most Controversial Episode Of 'Seinfeld'</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The whole inception of this came from Larry David making a bet in the 1980s.</span><p>It does not help that Seinfeld has now apparently crossed the billion dollar-mark in net worth. This essentially makes him the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">richest comedian in 2024</a>, ahead of the likes of Kevin Hart and <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=larry-david-lost-a-ton-of-money-in-a-divorce>Larry David Lost A Ton Of Money In A Divorce</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Audience members are clearly irked by the fact that Jerry Seinfeld is so much richer than Larry David. While this difference might trace back to the two extra seasons the former did on Seinfeld, the latter did lose a massive chunk of his wealth when his divorce to former wife Laurie was officially finalized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around this time, a lot of publications were swinging wildly when it came to predictions about exactly how rich David was. Most of this put his total assets value at anywhere near $200 million and $800 million.</p><p>Things came to a head when the comedian was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">interviewed on a 60 Minutes segment by Charlie Rose</a>, who suggested that David was worth $500 million. The Curb Your Enthusiasm star was quick to refute the claims, as he reminded his interviewer that a half of his entire riches went to Laurie.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:01</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-28t163250-287.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld Revealed The Sad Truth Of Writing A Seinfeld Script With Larry David</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jerry Seinfeld admitted that he and Larry David were "killing themselves" behind the scenes on Seinfeld.</span><p>“The figures that I read about the amount of money that I've made are so ridiculous, and it's absurd,” David said to Rose. “I don't have that kind of money!

Celebrity Net Worth estimates that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he is valued at $400 million</a>. A lot of that can still be attributed to his income from Seinfeld, but like his counterpart, David has continued working steadily since.</p><p>Soon after leaving the NBC sitcom, the two-time Primetime Emmy Award winner wrote and starred as a fictional version of himself in Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm. This was a one-hour scripted comedy special which aired on HBO in October 1999.</p><p>The episode made way for ten more, which made up the entirety of the new sitcom’s first season. David would then go on to enjoy incredible success with the show, which went on to last a total of 12 seasons of ten episodes each.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Brooklyn-born star also penned and acted in the Broadway production Fish in the Dark.
