But like many young women in the entertainment business, Swift's physical appearance is constantly under scrutiny.</p><p>The <strong>5'10 "Anti-Hero" singer </strong>has been renowned for her girl next door, all-Americana beauty since she <strong>first became famous in 2006</strong>. But <a href=#>the prolific songwriter</a> and <a href=#>incredibly rich pop music superstar</a> has been <strong>accused of making certain adjustments to her face and body</strong>.</p><p>These<strong> plastic surgery accusations </strong>were exacerbated in February 2024 when a Daily Mail report shed light on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what some experts believe Swift did to transform her appearance</a>. Here are the rumors about <strong>'Taylor Swift's before and after'</strong> and if they are even remotely true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-get-any-plastic-surgery-on-her-chest>Did Taylor Swift Get Any Plastic Surgery On Her Chest?</h2><p>While<strong> Taylor Swift</strong> hasn't been the prime candidate for plastic surgery rumors as much <a href=#>as her best friend Selena Gomez has</a>, she certainly has been <strong>accused of altering her body</strong>. The most prevalent accusation is that Swift had a boob job. One of the earliest <strong>reports that Swift enhanced her chest</strong> came in 2019 when Life & Style inquired into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an apparent change in the size of her bust</a>. This came after the rumors started to trend on Twitter (now X) following Swift's appearance in a low-cut dress at The Golden Globes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/taylor-swift-music-awards.jpg><p>The Twitter user showed side-by-side images of Swift appearing to have a much "flatter" chest just a couple of years earlier. The user also claimed that the 'boob job' was the 'best' in the history of Hollywood. Likely because the change was so subtle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Life & Style asked a board-certified plastic surgeon named Dr. Norman Rowe if the Twitter accusations held water. In response, he said the following:</p><p>"[Taylor Swift] had a breast augmentation. This is the only explanation."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-good-morning-america.jpg><p>It should be noted that Dr. Rowe has never treated Taylor Swift and therefore he has no absolute way of knowing if she has or hasn't. <strong>Swift has also never commented </strong>on whether or not she has made any adjustments to the size of her chest over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some Twitter and Reddit users claim she could just be wearing more supportive bras and dresses that accentuate her chest. This would seemingly fall in line with the more adult image Swift has created for herself over the past few years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/taylor-swift-bags-several-awards-at-the-mtv-europe-music-awards-2022.jpg><p>But<strong> rumors of Taylor Swift receiving a breast augmentation</strong> poked their head again on February 15th, 2024, when The Daily Mail published an article that included accusations from a notable plastic surgeon. These accusations were not just limited to what Taylor Swift may or may not have done with her body but featured other celebrities as well.</p><ul><li>The Daily Mail's article featuring Dr. Everett also accused Bella Hadid, Megan Fox, and Olivia Rodrigo of having work done to their chests.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_jack-antonoff-revealed-what-taylor-swift-is-really-like-when-recording-an-album_bk_a1_v4.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jack Antonoff Finally Revealed The Truth About What Taylor Swift Is Really Like To Work With</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift and music producer Jack Antonoff have one of the most fruitful creative partnerships in the business.</span><p>Dr. Marc Everett, a highly-rated plastic surgeon based in New York City, was interviewed by The Daily Mail. In the article, Everett claimed that Taylor Swift received Swift actually received <strong>a "modest" implant back in 2012</strong>. He claimed that she received <strong>a second procedure in 2022</strong>. Of course, these are merely accusations. But he claimed that a small "triangle-shaped mark" on her chest proves it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-awards-2022-1.jpg><p><strong>Dr. Everett believes Taylor Swift received submuscular implants</strong>, which can cause this triangle-shaped mark. He also rejected claims from Swift's fans that the apparent changes to the size of her breasts are merely due to a healthy weight gain -- Swift, after all, was famously much skinnier when she first became famous as a teenager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Around the time of her first alleged surgery, you can see in photos that she is quite thin," Dr. Everett said to The Daily Mail.</p><p>"But there is this forced rounder breast shape that has become disproportionate to the rest of her body."</p><p>Dr. Everett continued by saying, "The breast is made up of both gland and fat and, when you have a degree of weight loss, breasts are not going to be as dense." He then said that this is not the case for Swift, referring to a few images of her at the 2022 MTV Music Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52180554.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You can also see the distinct round curve of the implant where the dress is pushing the breast inward."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/how-much-money-did-taylor-swift-make-the-nfl-after-their-most-watched-super-bowl-ever_-front-deposit-back-nfl_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Much Money Did Taylor Swift Make The NFL After Their Most-Watched Super Bowl Ever?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Thanks to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship, the 2024 Super Bowl was wildly successful, and that resulted in a huge payday for the NFL.</span><p>These accusations are not limited to these two plastic surgeons. Numerous others on YouTube and TikTok have also made similar accusations, as have some of Swift's fans. But the pop star has never confirmed that any of this is true. So, for the time being, we <strong>have to believe that these rumors are completely false</strong>.</p><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-make-any-changes-to-her-face>Did Taylor Swift Make Any Changes To Her Face?</h2><p>Another prevention rumor regarding <strong>Taylor Swift possibly getting plastic surgery on her face</strong>. A plastic surgeon on TikTok named Dr. Anthony Youn, MD, addressed numerous claims fans have made about the superstar. This includes <strong>rumors that Taylor Swift got a brow lift, upper eyelid surgery, rhinoplasty, and lip fillers</strong>. The board-certified plastic surgeon stated that there were no obvious signs Swift had any plastic surgery on her face before she was 22 years old in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Youn did notice a difference in Swift's face after she turned 23, in 2012, however.</p><p>"[Taylor Swift's] face does look like it's getting a bit leaner and some people have accused her of undergoing a buccal fat pad removal to help narrow and thin her cheeks."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-shocked-fans-after-revealing-intense-anxiety-around-her-new-music-leaking-deposit.jpg><p>According to the article that Dr. Youn was quoted in by She Finds, the surgeon believes that a loss in weight is the real reason Swift's face looked different after the age of 22. He stated the same thing when Swift turned 24 and 25 when her face seemingly transformed further. Accusations around this time included that Taylor Swift received lip injections. However, Dr. Youn believes that this was simply "lip lining" and not injections.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:03</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-parents-may-live-a-life-of-luxury-despite-false-claims-about-their-abandoned-tiktok-mansion-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Parents May Live A Life Of Luxury Despite False Claims About Their Abandoned TikTok Mansion</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What is the truth about how Taylor Swift's parents live following rumors about their mansion?</span><p>As for rhinoplasty and the changes to Swift's nose following her disappearance from the public stage in 2017, Dr. Youn believes it's possible. He agreed with rumors that Swift's nose looked a "little shorter" and "a little more refined".</p><p>"If that nose job was done, it was very, very subtle."</p><p>At this time, there has been no official confirmation that Taylor Swift received any plastic surgery on her face. So, this also seems to be false.</p><h3 id=does-taylor-swift-wear-veeners>Does Taylor Swift Wear Veeners?</h3><p>Among possible alterations to her face and chest, many fans have wondered <a href=#>what happened to Taylor Swift's teeth</a>. Rumors first began after Swift publicly hipped her tooth in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her tooth was fixed, Swift's smile seemed more perfect than ever. Some fans believe that Swift's teeth are entirely fake and that she wears veneers. But while Swift almost definitely fixed her teeth after the chip, there's no evidence to suggest they've all been replaced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1loKGutMDInGSsraKcsrPFjKuspqeiqHqktMCnnp6rXam8brLAnJxmmZ6ZeqO7w7Jm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-plastic-surgery-rumors-changes-to-face-and-body.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-plastic-surgery-rumors-changes-to-face-and-body.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-plastic-surgery-rumors-changes-to-face-and-body.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-plastic-surgery-rumors-changes-to-face-and-body.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-plastic-surgery-rumors-changes-to-face-and-body.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-plastic-surgery-rumors-changes-to-face-and-body.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-dolan-twins-of-youtube-sell-california-home-for-almost-3-million.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-dolan-twins-of-youtube-sell-california-home-for-almost-3-million.html>The Dolan Twins Of YouTube Sell California Home For Almost $3 Million</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./spencer-webb-dead-at-22-from-cliff-diving-accident-what-to-know.html>Spencer Webb Dead at 22 From Cliff-Diving Accident: What to Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./spencer-webb-dead-at-22-from-cliff-diving-accident-what-to-know.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
