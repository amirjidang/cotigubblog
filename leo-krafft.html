He died on August 25, 2023, as per <strong>Panthers Wroclaw</strong> statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.uptospeedjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Leo-Krafft-2.jpg><p>The player was taken promptly to the hospital, but he died after an hour. The prosecutor’s office is handling the case.Even many outside the sports community were horrified by the untimely death of the Norwegian defensive star.</p><p>His death news was announced through<strong> Panthers Wroclaw’s</strong> official Facebook page:</p><p></p><p>“We received shocking news about our player’s death this morning. Leo was 28 years old from Norway; he joined the Panthers team in April and was a vital player of the European League of Football Squad.&nbsp; We are deeply shocked after getting the news. Condolences to Leo’s family on behalf of our team and owners. Rest in peace, Leo.”</p><h2>Death Cause:</h2><p>According to information from Wojciech Jaboski from the Municipal Police Headquarters in Wroclaw, the incident happened on Friday, August 25, late at night at one of the housing complexes. Around 10 o’clock, the police received a report that a man was causing a disturbance. A Norwegian man named Leo Krafft, 28, pleaded guilty.</p><p>According to the police report, he confessed to the uniformed officers that he had ingested beer and taken drugs earlier. He also pointed out where the marijuana and methamphetamine were. Krafft reportedly turned hostile during the intervention; he defied orders and pulled repeatedly, according to Wojciech Jaboski.</p><p>The uniformed individuals “direct coercive measures causing the lowest possible discomfort of their use” and asked for another patrol. The cop exchanges handcuffs and physical force.</p><p>Due to his psychophysical condition and later discovered breathing problems, the uniforms called paramedics to the scene to continue the activities in a way that provided maximum safety. When the Medical Rescue Team arrived, the patient was still very agitated, so the physicians administered sedatives.</p><p>Sadly, he began to feel faint shortly after receiving them and eventually passed out. Once professional cardiac resuscitation was started, his vital functions were restored. Krafft was reportedly transported by ambulance to a hospital in Wroclaw, where he tragically lost unexpectedly after spending more than an hour.</p><p>A skilled athlete’s sudden passing is usually a devastating event that has an impact on teammates, coaches, supporters, and even those who do not personally know the person.Condolences and prayers to his family, friends, and teammates; Leo’s funeral and burial services have not been disclosed publicly.</p><h2><strong>About Leo Krafft</strong></h2><p>A defense player from Norway was named Leo Krafft.

He persisted in spite of this.</p><p>There was no nearby organized football, though. If he couldn’t play football in Norway, he would travel further.

Approximately 8,000 people would come up to watch the squad play on Friday nights.</p><h2><strong>Know About Leo Krafft’s Career</strong></h2><p>Krafft returned to Norway a year later and joined the Valerenga Trolls, a group that played an hour and a half away from his house.

He was a second reinforcement from <strong>Scandinavia</strong> for the Panthers, joining <strong>Timi Nuikka</strong> from Finland.</p><p>The <strong>Carlstad Crusaders, Valerenga Trolls, Eidsvoll 1814’s, </strong>and <strong>Oslo Vikings</strong> are just a few of the organizations the Norwegian defender has previously represented.
