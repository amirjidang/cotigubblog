Which is a huge reason as to why he detests him and has said many a bad thing about him.</p><h2 id=the-saddest-moment-in-a-child-s-life-is-not-when-he-learns-that-santa-claus-isn-t-real-it-s-when-he-learns-that-vince-russo-is><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>"The Saddest Moment In A Child's Life Is Not When He Learns That Santa Claus Isn't Real, It's When He Learns That Vince Russo Is."</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jim-Cornette-1280x720-Cropped.jpg><p>The first quote on this list is a major burn. Cornette despises Russo so much that he literally says his existence makes children sad. This isn't even the harshest quote on this list which speaks volumes about this rivalry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Wrestling's Biggest Rivalry: 5 Reasons Jim Cornette Is In The Right (& 5 Reasons Vince Russo Is)</a></span></p><p>However, it is hilarious as you can just imagine a young wrestling fan learning about Russo and being instantly disappointed.

Why you might ask? Because he wants to p*ss on his grave. Therefore, Cornette started a diet in an aim to beat Russo.</p><p>It's genuinely hilarious that Cornette is willing to change this much in his life because he hates Russo so much.</p><h2 id=the-grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side-unless-vince-russo-was-there-then-the-grass-is-probably-dead><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>"The Grass Is Greener On The Other Side.

Throwing huge shade over Russo's ability to run a company and talent into the ground. Mainly, talking about his time in charge of WCW and TNA. As he cared more about the short term rather than the long term gain.</p><p>Therefore, showing how hilarious this quote is from Cornette. As he quite simply puts it, do not go anywhere that involves Russo. Mainly because he has a knack for ruining things. Also, Cornette has a bit of a vendetta due to their real-life feud in TNA.</p><h2 id=vince-russo-destroyed-the-periodic-table-as-he-only-recognises-the-element-of-surprise><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>"Vince Russo Destroyed The Periodic Table As He Only Recognises The Element Of Surprise."</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jimcornette-1280x720-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This man can link anything in the world as an insult to Russo. Who would have ever thought that the periodic table would be used to mock someone?&nbsp; Well, actually it's not at all surprising considering it is Cornette that said it.</p><p>Producing another shot at <a href=#>Russo's questionable creative antics</a> in wrestling. Cornette has a point that Russo seriously damaged the business with his aim of always causing a shocking surprise. However, he put it in the most hilarious way possible.</p><h2 id=he-vince-russo-is-the-only-booker-i-ve-seen-who-doesn-t-get-people-over-he-gets-them-under><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>"He (Vince Russo) Is The Only Booker I've Seen Who Doesn't Get People Over, He Gets Them Under"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/x1080-3-Cropped.jpg><p>Another brilliant dig on Russo just not being very good at his job.

The fact a list can be made of quotes about Russo shows that Cornette is very much obsessed. Therefore, making this quote hilarious because he essentially already performs this job.</p><p>Of course, what makes this funnier is the fact there is truth to it. Russo has messed up a lot in the <a href=#>wrestling</a> business which has resulted in <a href=#>many people disliking him</a>.

This is what he produced. A mix of crass language and funny throw away words is what Cornette came up with. With Christian at the end being absolutely hilarious considering what came before it.</p><p>The fact he can easily come up with so many harsh words to describe the man speaks volumes of his hatred for him.
