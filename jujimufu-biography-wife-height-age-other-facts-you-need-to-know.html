Jujimufu became an internet pioneer with his famous acrobatic arts under the name of deception and built an online community long before the evolution of social media.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jujimufu-biography-age></span><strong><span>Jujimufu Biography, Age</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The anabolic acrobat was born Jon Call inHuntsville, Alabama in 1986. He has two siblings;&nbsp;a brother and a sister and parents who are always together and always so loving.&nbsp;As a child, he played video games and indulged in various other typical child activities, but he soon got tired of it and wanted something more challenging.&nbsp;A friend of his, who was already a black belt in taekwondo, introduced him to the art and it was love during the first trial.</span></p><p><span>At the age of 13, he started training in taekwondo which served as a bridge to get him into the gym and he also started dieting.&nbsp;Seeing his commitment to fitness and good health, his parents offered him a gym membership right across the street from his school in 2000. Therefore, after class each day as he waited for his parents to come on seek, he lifted weights, fell in love with deadlifts and squats and hasn’t stopped since.</span></p><p><span>After that, Call discovered the acrobatic martial arts aka trick which is an aesthetic mix of flips, twists and kicks at age 15.&nbsp;The discovery took him deep into the fitness world and he considers it the biggest pivotal change for him.&nbsp;Also, it sparked its entrepreneurial spirit leading to the creation of many how-to videos and articles about the online thing while social media was still an idea in the minds of its founders.&nbsp;Also in 2002, he formed an biography, online community of tricksters through his website trickstutorials.com which he ran until 2010, when he graduated from college.&nbsp;He is praised for his fun and fun approach to teaching.</span></p><p><span>Unlike other 15-year-old high schoolers, Jujimufu had the big picture of what he wanted and set a specific goal.&nbsp;He wanted to become flexible enough to get the free kata in his Taekwondo training.&nbsp;Therefore, he trained every night in less than 2 hours and in 2 months he got what he wanted.&nbsp;His years of commitment to training flexibility inspired an ebook on the same subject,&nbsp;</span><span>Legendary Flexibility</span></p><p><span>As he grew and accumulated more and more experience, he incorporated stunts and anabolic workouts into his trick regimen, resulting in an online coaching business,&nbsp;</span><span>Acrobolix</span><span>&nbsp;(a game of words on Acrobatic and Anabolic) in 2014. With its new brand, Jujimufu has developed increased credibility as an icon in the online fitness community.</span></p><p><span>With the advent of social media, he joined YouTube, Facebook, then Instagram in 2014 and began to gain momentum as an influencer.&nbsp;His exponentially growing IG (over 1.2 million subscribers) and geometrically growing YouTube channel (over 500,000 subscribers) have established him as an internet heavyweight.</span></p><p><span>Mastering his craft in addition to earning him accolades and internet celebrity status also increases prime-time appearances on national television.&nbsp;He gained national attention in 2016 when he appeared as a contestant on the 11th season of America’s Got Talent.&nbsp;He captivated the audience and the judges with his hanging chair with dumbbells.</span></p><p><span>After that he got one of the judges Heidi Klum up and in turn got yes from the judges including Howie Mandel, Mel B and Simon Cowell who sent him to the Judge Cuts.</span></p><p>Sur son modèle d’entraînement, il fait la résistances’entraînant environ six jours par semaine, et pendant l’été et l’automne, il fait trois tours par semaine. Pour suivre son régime, il se nourrit d’un régime générique de culturiste qui comprend 6 repas par jour qui comprend un ratio PCF (protéines, glucides, lipides) quotidien de 40:40:20.</p><p><span>Jon Call pursued his passion and invested in his ideas which ultimately paid off.&nbsp;Not only does he have an epic life, but he also raises money by having fun and being himself on a daily basis.&nbsp;He was the CTO of a small biotech company for 7 years, but quit his job in December 2016 to focus fully on creating content and building his own businesses.&nbsp;He aims to expand his product line and express his fitness abilities with a coloring of humor and wisdom to reach the widest audience.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-jujimufu-married-wife></span><strong><span>Is Jujimufu married?&nbsp;wife</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The self-attributed anabolic acrobat is a married man.&nbsp;Although he didn’t give details about his partner, he did mention her in an interview and shared a video of some goals on his Instagram feed.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jujimufus-height-and-other-facts-you-need-to-know></span><strong><span>Jujimufu’s Height and Other Facts You Need to Know</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>He may not be the greatest of bodybuilders, but he is a man’s carcass.&nbsp;Call possesses the body of a strongman and the flexibility of a gymnast and his incredibly acrobatic feats channel larger than life wrestlers like Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage.</span></p><p><span>The blond, curly-haired acrobat is 1.80m (5ft 11in) tall and weighs 107kg (235lbs).&nbsp;His max lifts include a 650 lb deadlift, a 405 lb bench press, and a 550 lb back squat.</span></p><p><span>He adopted the nickname Jujimufu when he was 14 after several failed attempts to choose an AOL messenger username.&nbsp;It’s his absurd creation in a fit of rage against the keyboard.</span></p><p><span>He developed the largest community of fraudsters online before social media became the go-to place for learning.&nbsp;Call has also built a significant YouTube and Instagram following and her own fitness brand.</span></p><p class=postsid
