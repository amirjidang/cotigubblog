<time>14 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Carole Baskin suddenly shot to fame more or less overnight when the hit Netflix series Tiger King came to our screens in early 2020. The series focused on Joe Exotic, who owned G.W. Zoo, and showed glimpses of his feud with Baskin, who is the CEO of Big Cat Rescue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show very quickly became a big hit with fans and was a massive talking point on social media at the time, as well as remaining a show that many still talk about to this day. Given this and the fact that Baskin was one of the main stars to come out of the show, this has led many to question whether she actually made any money from the show.</p><h2 id=what-is-carole-baskin-39-s-net-worth>What Is Carole Baskin's Net Worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Carole-Baskin-9.jpg><p>With starring in one of Netflix's biggest shows, one would only assume that like many other stars, Baskin would have quite a high net worth. As of November 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baskin's net worth</a> is believed to be around the $7 million mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is not completely known how Baskin managed to amass this amount of money, however, there are some factors that will have helped her make this amount of money.</p><p>Most of this is likely to come as a result of the assumed death of her former husband, Don Lewis. Lewis went missing in 1997 and as he has not been since it has long been assumed that he is dead. This was legally declared five years later in 2002.</p><p>It was, in part, due to the public assumption that Baskin knows what happened to her husband that caused <a href=#>public outrage when she was announced as one of the contestants on Dancing With The Stars</a> in 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Carole Baskin's Husband Was Declared Dead, But She Says He's Still Alive</a></span></p><p>Due to this and as she was his wife at the time, Baskin inherited the majority of his $6 million estate. Whilst this does not make up her full net worth, it is likely to be the main reason behind a large sum of this money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of this money will also come from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">money she earns as CEO of the Big Cat Rescue</a>.</p><h2 id=did-carole-baskin-make-any-money-from-tiger-king>Did Carole Baskin Make Any Money From Tiger King?</h2><p>Given the prominence of Tiger King and the fact that it drew in an audience of 64 million households worldwide during the first month of its release and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second series was streamed for 30 million hours</a> worldwide in its first five days (for context, the second series lasts for three and a half hours overall), many would assume that the stars of the hit show would get paid.</p><p>However, if you were expecting Baskin or any of the stars of the hit Netflix show to get paid a lot of money for their appearance in the show, especially given the number of people who viewed the show, then you thought wrong.</p><p>As a general rule of thumb, most people will <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not be paid any money for starring in a documentary</a>. So, because Tiger King has been labeled as a documentary by Netflix, this means that it is highly unlikely that Baskin or anyone else who was featured in this documentary was actually paid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Carole Baskin Dragged As She Reveals Actress She Wants To Play Her In Movie</a></span></p><p>Of course, this hasn't actually been confirmed by Netflix or anyone who worked on the show, whether that was behind the scenes or in front of the camera, so it cannot be said for certain that Baskin wasn't paid any money.</p><p>However, due to her various TV appearances that likely came as a result of starring in the show, such as various TV interviews and even an <a href=#>appearance on Dancing With The Stars that didn't go down well with fans</a>, while she may not have made any money directly from Tiger King, she will have made some money from these appearances.</p><h2 id=how-is-carole-baskin-linked-to-joe-exotic>How Is Carole Baskin Linked To Joe Exotic?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is well known that Tiger King mostly centered around Joe Exotic, the owner of G.W. Zoo at the time the documentary was being made. But given that Baskin is another one of the more popular stars from the documentary, many people might question how the two exactly came to know one another.</p><p>Both stars of the show have been in a feud for many years and this was more than prominent in the show, however, what you may or may not know is what exactly led to the beginning of this feud and where the two now stand with one another.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joe Exotic Starts GoFundMe Begging For Help To Pay Back Carole Baskin</a></span></p><p>This feud first started due to Baskin being very open about the fact that she disagreed with the work that Exotic was doing, paying particular focus to how he treats animals and abuses tigers. However, this did seem to then work slightly in Baskin's favor as she was <a href=#>awarded control over the zoo</a> after years of lawsuits between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Viewers of the show will know that Exotic was less than happy with these accusations and made allegations of his own, including that Baskin had killed her husband and had fed him to some big cats. With the two consistently firing shots at each other, it's safe to say that there's unlikely to be a reconciliation of the pair anytime soon.</p><p>Regardless of how Baskin and Exotic feel about one another, Baskin, in particular, has done pretty well financially, whether that was down to being in Tiger King or not.</p><p>With Baskin not seeming to want to shy away from the spotlight any time soon, with her <a href=#>getting her own spin-off series</a>Carole Baskin's Cage Fight on Discovery+, it's pretty safe to say that her net worth is only going to continue to grow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkqHqkrdGoo55lkpbArLXNrGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhats-carole-baskins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhats-carole-baskins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhats-carole-baskins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhats-carole-baskins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhats-carole-baskins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhats-carole-baskins-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./djvlad-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./djvlad-net-worth.html>Djvlad Djvlad Net Worth How Much is Djvlad Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./daryl-sabara-net-worth.html>Daryl Sabara Net Worth How Much is Daryl Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./daryl-sabara-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
