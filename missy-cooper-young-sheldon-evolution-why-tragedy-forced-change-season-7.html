After being ignored by her parents and favored less than her two brothers, she started to act out and even ran away from home. In season 7, audiences see a different side of the now-teenage girl, who embarked on a more caring role within her family.</p><p>After her <a href=#>near-death experience in the tornado, </a>Missy decides to take on new responsibilities and ditch her more rebellious side.

In season 6, episode 22, "A Tornado, a 10-Hour Flight and a Darn Fine Ring,” Missy and George are trapped and facing death. Since her rebellion, she has struggled to get along with mother, Mary, but has become closer to her father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Sheldon is in Germany, the Cooper family's small hometown is destroyed by a tornado. In the aftermath of the tornado, she promises George Sr. that her era of being a teenage rebel is over. After the incident, <strong>Missy Cooper takes on a more maternal role, taking over from the absent Mary to look after her family and home.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:10</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_young-sheldon-photos-of-the-cast-then-vs-now_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Young Sheldon: Photos Of The Cast Then Vs.

Missy soon learns that having responsibilities and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mimicking her mother isn't as fun as it seems.</a></p><p>"She’s still a 13-year-old girl. We talked about this a lot going into the [final] season because she had some trouble last season. Where we landed was that after the tornado and that big moment with Dad, it felt like she had turned a little bit of a corner."</p><p>He added that "with Meemaw’s house being destroyed and Mary being away, this was her chance to step up." But by the second episode of season 7 of Young Sheldon, she starts to "realize that being Mom isn’t quite as fun as it seemed at first."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether she starts to rebel in the upcoming seventh season is uncertain, but based on what audiences know about Missy Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, things will be tough for Missy.</p><p>During Georgie's The Big Bang Theory season 11 debut, he reveals that Missy acted as a "dumb teenager" after their father's untimely death. If <a href=#>we see George Cooper's death in the last season of Young Sheldon</a>, it could cause changes that impact the grown-up Missy.</p><h2 id=what-missy-cooper-was-like-throughout-young-sheldon>What Missy Cooper Was Like Throughout Young Sheldon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/missy-cooper-young-sheldon.jpg><p>Sheldon Cooper's twin sister, Missy, might not be as gifted academically as her brother, but she is very charming and friendly.

She is "neglected" by her parents, who are usually too busy cleaning up Georgie's mess or helping with the needy Sheldon.

When she does visit her brother on the CBS comedy, Sheldon is more concerned with which of his friends she might date than how he is doing.</p><p>In her last appearance, Missy Cooper is pregnant with her and her husband's second chance despite being on the brink of divorce. An older Sheldon reveals in a voiceover that Missy finds happiness, re-marries and has more children.
