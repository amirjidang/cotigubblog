Then his most successful single yet ‘Bottoms Up’ sold over four million units in the US, thus, contributing to Songz’s total record sales of over 25 million.

Later in July 2005, he dropped his first studio album titled ‘I Gotta Make It’ which sold about 40,000 units in its first week of release and peaked at No. 20 on Billboard 200 and No. 6 on R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart.

The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned many commercially successful singles which also attained certifications from the RIAA.</p><p>They include ‘Can’t Help But Wait’ – a soundtrack he provided for the film, Step Up 2 the Streets which peaked at No. 14 on Billboard Hot 100 and No. 2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart.

Gucci Mane and Soulja Boy, ‘I Invented Sex’ feat. Drake, ‘Neighbors Know My Name’, and ‘Say Aah’ feat. Fabolous. The latter peaked at No. 9 on Hot 100 and No. 3 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart and sold over two million copies in the United States, attaining double-platinum from the RIAA.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-had-huge-success-with-passion-pain-pleasure-chapter-v-and-trigga></span><strong>He Had Huge Success With Passion, Pain & Pleasure, Chapter V, And Trigga</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Trey Songz had unprecedented success in 2010 when he dropped his fourth studio album ‘Passion, Pain & Pleasure’ which also contributes to his staggering net worth. It debuted at No. 2 on Billboard 200 and No. 1 on R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. The album’s lead single ‘Bottoms Up’ feat. Nicki Minaj peaked at No. 6 on US Hot 100 and No. 2 on R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, selling more than four million units as it attained four-times platinum certification from the RIAA, becoming Trey Songz’s most successful single yet.</p><p>He reportedly amassed over $1.7 million from the sales of ‘Passion, Pain & Pleasure’ which also spawned other platinum-certified singles such as ‘Can’t Be Friends’ and ‘Love Faces’. Songz followed up his hit-making streak with the release of ‘Chapter V’, his fifth studio album in August 2012. It debuted atop US Billboard 200 and posted sales of 135,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the RIAA, as it gathered combined sales and streaming equivalent units of more than 500,000 units in the United States.</p><p>The album’s singles ‘Heart Attack’ and ‘2 Reasons’ featuring T. I have each sold more than one million units in the United States, gaining platinum certification with another of the album’s single ‘Dive In’ attaining gold certification. The Grammy nominee’s subsequent albums include ‘Trigga’ which debuted atop US Billboard 200 and US R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart and ‘Tremaine the Album’ that clinched the No. 3 spot on Billboard 200 and No. 1 on R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart.</p><p>His eight studio album ‘Back Home’ was released in October 2020.
