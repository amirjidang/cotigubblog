Beyoncé was the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of éthe most successful female groups ever. And<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jay-Z </a>was no slouch, having already founded Roc-A-Fella records in 1995 and the clothing line Rocawear in 1999.</p><p>The official story is that they met "by accident" on a plane going to an&nbsp;MTV&nbsp;festival in 2000. It was the collision of two very different worlds, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé</a> nice middle-class one, and Jay-Z's street-savvy, up from the ghetto life.</p><p>Beyoncé's father, Matthew Knowles, also managed Beyoncé and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Destiny's Child</a>. And the word was he wasn't exactly thrilled by the prospect of his baby girl/meal ticket hooking up with the rapper why? It's complicated, both personal and professional. But let's just say that the unpredictable Knowles was wary of Jay-Z on both a personal and professional level. And maybe he was a little jealous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what's the real story of exactly what Matthew Knowles thought of Jay-Z and Beyoncé's relationship? It's both complicated and simple. Read on.</p><h2 id=jay-z-and-beyonc-two-worlds-collide>Jay-Z And Beyoncé: Two Worlds Collide</h2><p>Jay-Z grew up on the streets of Brooklyn's Mercy Housing Project. It was a violent, drug-ridden kind of place. His father deserted his mother Gloria Carter when Jay-Z was 11. When he was 12-years-old, Jay-Z shot his brother in a dispute over a ring. For a time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z was a drug dealer. </a>It was anything thing for a buck in those days. Then in 1999, he got off with probation after he pleaded guilty to stabbing record producer Lance Rivera. Seems Hova thought Lance had done a bootleg release of one of his albums. And he was mad. And on the streets, knives and guns often do the talking</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 20 Things About Jay-Z Beyoncé Wishes She Could Sweep Under The Carpet</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyoncé, in stark contrast, was born into a middle-class family in Houston, Texas. Her mom Tina Knowles (née Beyoncé) owned a salon and her dad Matthew was a sales manager. She did the middle-class Montessori School thing and was a soloist in the choir of her family's Methodist Church. It was the total middle-class experience.</p><p>Then that fateful meeting with Jay-Z in 2000. Beyoncé was around 18-years-old and Jay-Z was some 12 years older. He was edgy hip-hop and she was polished and glamourous. On paper, it didn't seem much of a match. But perhaps it was a case of opposites attract. Maybe Jay-Z wanted to polish up his image. Perhaps Beyoncé was drawn to his hard on the outside, soft on the inside personality.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Facts About How Beyoncé And Jay-Z Got Together</a></span></p><p>By 2002, an edgier Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaborated on the&nbsp;&nbsp;03, Bonnie and Clyde&nbsp;album.</p><p>Reportedly, Matthew Knowles sat up and took notice when Jay-Z came on the scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-knowles-didn-t-like-jay-z>Matthew Knowles Didn't Like Jay-Z</h2><p>Before Jay-Z came along, Matthew Knowles had long since given up sale and was managing Destiny's Child. It was, to say the least, a nice little earner. Rumors about his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"liberating" some of Beyoncé's funds</a> means that having Jay-Z on the scene looking over his shoulder could have been a threat to Knowles.</p><p>Plus, it is well known that Hova wanted Bey to project an edgier image. Matthew objected. Did dad feel threatened? Almost certainly, on both a personal and professional level.</p><p>It's not surprising that,&nbsp; long before the couple was married, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew went on record saying he wasn't fond</a> of the rapper. No, he didn't want to spend time with the guy. He reportedly said: "I don't care for him at all. No, I'm not close to him. He is not somebody I like to spend time with." Well, that's pretty clear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's true that Matthew felt threatened by Jay-Z and his influence over Bey. And rumor has it that Matthew was concerned about Jay-Z's background, his ghetto upbringing. The idea that his little earner, girl, was hanging out with a guy from the 'Hood who was a former drug dealer can't have gone down well. Add to all of that the fact Jay-Z was 12 years older than Bey and you have an awkward situation. Even her fans had their doubts about the relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life Aboard Jay-Z And Beyoncé's $70 Million Yacht</a></span></p><p>But, as the world knows, they persevered, announcing they were a couple around 2004 and finally marrying in 2008. Word on the street is that Bey is estranged from her dad. Something about his cheating on her mom and her money that maybe became his money.</p><p>It hasn't all been clear sailing.</p><h2 id=that-elevator-battle-with-solange>That Elevator Battle With Solange</h2><p>Sure, it was 2014, years after they married. But the fact that Solange attacked Jay-Z in an elevator after the Met Gala speaks volumes. Her family has never really and truly liked the guy. Maybe the attack was about his "alleged" cheating, but all that anger and resentment had to have come from somewhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And these days? Bey and Jay-Z appear to be solid. Even Matthew Knowles has to be impressed by his son-in-law. After all, he is a billionaire and he reportedly makes Queen B very happy. And that's what counts in the end.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Solange Knowles: Little Known Facts About Beyoncé's Younger Sister</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp2WknbJursSgoKemmaO0bsPHsmSbnamku6Sx0madmqWZocZuw8Cnq56cXZ2ys3nTqGSdrZ2lequt2GaxaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fin-the-beginning-why-beyonces-family-wanted-her-to-dump-jay-z.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fin-the-beginning-why-beyonces-family-wanted-her-to-dump-jay-z.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fin-the-beginning-why-beyonces-family-wanted-her-to-dump-jay-z.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fin-the-beginning-why-beyonces-family-wanted-her-to-dump-jay-z.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fin-the-beginning-why-beyonces-family-wanted-her-to-dump-jay-z.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fin-the-beginning-why-beyonces-family-wanted-her-to-dump-jay-z.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-one-country-legit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-one-country-legit.html>Is One Country Legit?
