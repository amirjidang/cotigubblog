He has millions of fans who listen to every episode which is why he has been able to negotiate an incredibly high salary for himself to host the podcast.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Rogan Has A Surprising Take On 'Anti-Men' Claims About The Barbie Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Rogan is the star of his podcast, several other people play a key role in the show’s production. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, how much does Rogan pay the people who help make his podcast a reality?</p><p><strong>Updated August 2023:</strong> Joe Rogan never intended for his podcast to be as successful as it is today when he started it in 2009. But with the number of followers he gained in short order, streaming platforms took notice. Because of this, Rogan was able to sign a multi-year contract with Spotify worth over $200 million.</p><p>While the podcast has had its troubles in more recent days, from using derogatory language to providing misinformation about COVID, Spotify did not pull the plug on the podcast completely. Instead, they chose to not cancel Rogan but to delete the podcasts that were offensive and misleading in nature.</p><p>This became a learning experience for Rogan, who was fortunate enough to not lose his most valued employee and friend, Jamie Vernon in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'The Joe Rogan Experience' remains one of the most popular podcasts on Spotify.

Instead, Rogan wanted to have a "discussion amongst friends." The UFC sportscaster had no idea that his podcast would take off and become as popular as it did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve never tried to do anything with this podcast other than just talk to people and have interesting conversations," Rogan explained. "I didn’t plan it I can’t believe it’s as successful as it is. It was never really an idea that I had. The podcast started off to be... with my friends and having fun and talking and then when it became popular, other people wanted to come on. I was like, 'Oh it’d be cool to talk to that person. Oh, he’s interesting. Oh, she’s got a cool book out' and then boom it’s become what it is today. Which is like some out-of-control juggernaut that I barely have control of."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Rogan Still Regrets A Mistake He Made With Anthony Bourdain Years After The Celebrity Chef's Passing</a></span></p><p>Now known for his unique interview style, Rogan has proven time and time again that he can get his guests to open up and reveal things they typically keep close to the chest. Once Rogan mastered his interviewing skills, the podcast seemed to become a huge deal practically overnight.

Of course, anyone who has listened to The Joe Rogan Experience would know that Rogan would bristle at such a label. Still, Rogan hasn’t been shy about cashing in on all of his success as he is very open about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the deal he struck with Spotify that was worth more than $200 million</a>.</p><p>This figure was astounding when it was announced, given that the originally reported figure that Spotify agreed to pay Rogan was $100 million.

He currently owns and operates a comedy club in Austin, Texas as well that <a href=#>requires club goers to get a facial scan on entry.</a></p><h2 id=how-much-does-joe-rogan-pay-producer-jamie-vernon>How Much Does Joe Rogan Pay Producer Jamie Vernon?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar41903601.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, there is one member of The Joe Rogan Experience staff who could never be replaced and that is the show’s titular host. As a result, it makes all the sense in the world that he would take the vast majority of the money that the podcast brings in. That said, considering how successful The JRE has become, it also seems reasonable to assume the show’s key staff members are doing quite well financially.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, none of The Joe Rogan Experience’s staff members have publicly stated how much money they make from the show. That said, there are reports about how much Rogan’s right-hand man (in terms of the podcast), producer Jamie Vernon, gets paid for his role.</p><p>Based on how much money The Joe Rogan Experience has brought in over the years and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vernon's net worth of $700,000</a>, estimates put his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">annual salary at $200,000 per year</a>. While there is no way to know for sure how accurate those numbers are at this time, it seems very clear that Vernon makes a tidy sum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, those figures are to say nothing about the fringe benefits Vernon’s The Joe Rogan Experience role affords him from meeting and networking with celebrities and being able to attend UFC matches from time to time.</p><p>While the producer of The Joe Rogan Experience is getting paid a pretty penny for his work on the podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guests are not paid for their time</a>. This is not uncommon in the podcast community. Guests are interviewed by Rogan and are often provided funds for travel and hotels. But the real reason guests join The Joe Rogan Experience is for exposure and to reach a new audience to help build their brand or sell their products.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKOnlWK%2FsLPAp2Spmamoeqm10maqrZmWm3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-what-joe-rogan-pays-his-staff.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-what-joe-rogan-pays-his-staff.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-what-joe-rogan-pays-his-staff.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-what-joe-rogan-pays-his-staff.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-what-joe-rogan-pays-his-staff.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-joe-rogan-pays-his-staff.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-addams-family-90s-movie-doing-now-christina-ricci.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-addams-family-90s-movie-doing-now-christina-ricci.html>Here's What The Addams Family From The '90s Is Doing Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./helene-fischer-net-worth.html>Helene Fischer Net Worth How Much Is Helene Fischer Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./helene-fischer-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
