His restaurant, Le Pre Catelan, is his pride and joy, and he and his staff strive to provide outstanding meals to each and every customer who walks through these doors. The restaurant is located in the picturesque Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, and it has earned three Michelin stars for its cuisine. It is a high-class event from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave, and you should budget approximately 250 euros for yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=le-jules-verne-in-paris>Le Jules Verne in Paris</h2><p>This <a href=#>incredible eatery</a> can be found perched on the second level of the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris. It is widely considered to be among the most exclusive dining opportunities available in the country, as well as the cost reflects this status. The vistas speak for themselves; the atmosphere is truly unique, and there is no other restaurant in Paris that comes close to matching it, especially at night.</p><h2 id=le-cinq-in-paris>Le Cinq in Paris</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Within the Four Seasons Hotel in the 8th arrondissement of Paris is where you'll discover the restaurant Le Cinq.

Inside is where you'll find the expansion of Alain Ducasse's high-end dining facilities, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else in France (or probably Europe). The price of a predetermined meal here will be approximately 350 euros, grant or take a few.</p><h2 id=restaurant-guy-savoy-in-paris>Restaurant Guy Savoy in Paris</h2><p>Guy Savoy expects you to be in and out of the restaurant in under an hour and a half. The restaurant is located exactly on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the most renowned pedestrian bridge in Paris</a>. That's right, this establishment is only open for business five days a week and just for a little over an hour and a half each day. Your meal is served quickly and efficiently, and none of your time is squandered or taken for granted in any way. During your meal, you will have a view of the Eiffel Tower, and if you're lucky, the man who designed the tower will come to your table to meet you and greet you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=l-espadon-in-paris>L’Espadon in Paris</h2><p>This eatery may be found within the Ritz Hotel, which is located in the northernmost portion of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1st arrondissement in Paris</a>.

Different sections of the restaurant are used for the service of breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner, and the staff will continue to titillate you from the beginning to the end of your meal. It is definitely necessary to make reservations, and you should also dress appropriately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=le-meurice-in-paris>Le Meurice in Paris</h2><p>The prices at this establishment are significantly higher than those at Alain Ducasse's first restaurant.
