Unlike Ross and Rachel, who go through a lot of ups and downs in their relationship, Monica and Chandler seem perfect for each other. They begin as friends and then realize that they have serious romantic chemistry. Once they get a taste of what it’s like to be with each other, they can’t ever be apart again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Life throws a lot of obstacles at them, including infertility and having to relocate for work, but they manage to get through it all without letting it affect their relationship. There’s no doubt that these two are meant to be together. But that doesn’t mean their relationship is perfect!</p><p>Check out these 15 things that everyone ignores about Monica and Chandler’s relationship.</p><h2 id=monica-didn-rsquo-t-know-what-chandler-rsquo-s-job-was-for-a-while><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Monica Didn’t Know What Chandler’s Job Was For A While</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-and-chandler.jpg><p>When you’re in a serious relationship with someone, you should always know what their job is, right? So, it’s kind of a red flag that Monica doesn’t know what Chandler does for such a long time. Sure, it’s a running joke that nobody in the gang knows what Chandler does, but Monica should. She learns eventually, but it takes her a while!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chandler-runs-off-before-the-wedding-and-monica-doesn-rsquo-t-care><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Chandler Runs Off Before The Wedding And Monica Doesn’t Care</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-and-Chandler-wedding.jpg><p>It’s normal to get cold feet before your wedding day. However, it’s a much bigger deal if you actually try to flee the scene before your wedding day, and when Monica finds this out about Chandler, she should be shocked. But, she takes it surprisingly well for someone whose lifelong dream is to get married.</p><h2 id=monica-only-settles-for-chandler-because-she-can-rsquo-t-have-joey><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Monica Only Settles For Chandler Because She Can’t Have Joey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-and-Chandler-at-ross-wedding.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, Monica and Chandler end up being absolutely perfect for each other. But their relationship doesn’t start off so genuinely. Remember that Monica only settles for Chandler in London because she can’t have Joey. Chandler learns this and comes to be fine with it, but still. Not the stuff fairytales are made of!</p><h2 id=they-had-two-first-lsquo-i-love-you-rsquo-moments><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Had Two First ‘I Love You’ Moments</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-wearing-a-turkey-on-her-head.jpg><p>One thing that a lot of people ignore about Monica and Chandler’s relationship, is that they have two moments where they declare their love for each other for the first time. The first happens in Season Five when Monica puts a turkey on her head. The second happens a few episodes later when Chandler tells Phoebe that he’s in love with Monica and Monica acts shocked.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Fan Theories About Rachel Green Make Too Much Sense To Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=monica-repeatedly-rejects-chandler-before-they-get-together><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Monica Repeatedly Rejects Chandler Before They Get Together</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chandler-and-Monica.jpg><p>In the days when Monica and Chandler are just friends, he makes his feelings clear, calling her the most beautiful woman he’s ever met. He even asks if she would ever date him, to which she laughs in his face. She makes her lack of romantic feelings for him clear. For Chandler, this would be difficult to forget about.</p><h2 id=chandler-only-finds-her-attractive-after-she-rsquo-s-lost-weight><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Chandler Only Finds Her Attractive After She’s Lost Weight</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-and-Chandler-before.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the late 1980s, Chandler goes home with Ross for Thanksgiving and first meets Monica. While Monica develops a crush on him, Chandler calls her “fat” behind her back. Fast forward to the future and Chandler’s suddenly attracted to Monica who rejects him. He seems to only find her attractive after she’s lost weight.</p><h2 id=monica-acts-more-like-chandler-rsquo-s-mom-sometimes-than-his-partner><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Monica Acts More Like Chandler’s Mom Sometimes Than His Partner</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-and-chandler-and-babies.jpg><p>We still think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monica and Chandler</a> are the best couple on the show, but there are certain times when Monica acts more like his mother than his girlfriend or wife. She always has that controlling personality, but it seems to get worse once she’s in a relationship with Chandler. In this way, he seems to bring out the worst in her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=monica-doesn-rsquo-t-seem-to-know-the-basics-of-chandler-rsquo-s-personality><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Monica Doesn’t Seem To Know The Basics Of Chandler’s Personality</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-and-Chandler-hugging.jpg><p>Despite being in a serious relationship, Monica appears to not know as much about Chandler as she should. Honestly, how could she not know that calling another guy the ‘funniest guy she’s ever met’ would upset him? Being funny is Chandler’s thing and she should know that, even before they start dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things That Never Made Sense About Ross And Chandler's Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=chandler-doesn-rsquo-t-even-know-about-monica-rsquo-s-secret-closet><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Chandler Doesn’t Even Know About Monica’s Secret Closet</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/friends-the-one-with-the-secret-closet.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are also a few things that Chandler should know about Monica but doesn’t. For example, it’s just a little strange that he doesn’t know about her secret messy closet. You don’t have to know every single detail about your spouse’s life, but considering Chandler lives in the apartment too, this seems like something he would have come across.</p><h2 id=monica-wanted-to-humiliate-chandler-and-ended-up-cutting-off-his-toe><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Monica Wanted To Humiliate Chandler And Ended Up Cutting Off His Toe</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monica-cutting-off-Chandlers-toe.jpg><p>Monica and Chandler’s relationship in the later seasons of the show is perfect in so many ways.
