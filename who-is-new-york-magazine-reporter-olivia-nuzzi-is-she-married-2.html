In 2017, he interviewed White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci which led to the director’s dismissal. Same year he was indicted for indecent assault and was dismissed after working at The New Yorker for a decade. He has been a senior political analyst for CNN since 2012 and was suspended briefly due to the allegations but came back on air six weeks later.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-reporter></span>Olivia Nuzzi Reporter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Olivia is a political reporter for&nbsp; New York Magazine since 2017. She the magazine’s first ever Washington correspondent. She also writes about congress in the magazine and its Daily Intel blog.</p><p>She began her career in journalism at the age of 18 writing for TriCity News and was also a regular contributor to the conservative blog More Monmouth Musings. She interned in Anthony Weiner’s 2013 mayoral campaign for four weeks before joining N/SFWcorp.</p><p>After she joined N/SFWcorp she was highly critical of Weiner and his senior staff in her stories. In one of the blogs, she wrote about her internship experience where she claimed that Weiner called her and 20 other female interns “Monica” because he failed to remember their names.</p><p>She was later hired by the New York Daily News to write a follow-up piece about interning for Weiner. In 2014, she was hired by the Daily Beast to cover the presidential campaigns of Republican hopefuls Rand Paul and Chris Christie. During her tenure, she wrote stories about Donald Trump’s rise as a Republican leader.</p><p>In 2016, Politico named her among the “16 Breakout Media Stars” of the presidential election. Same year, she was in Mediaite’s list of 25 “most influential” people in the news media.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-donald-trump></span>Olivia Nuzzi Donald Trump<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In October 2018, Nuzzi was invited for an exclusive interview in the Oval Office by the then president Donald Trump. On December 23, 2022 she wrote an investigative article on Donald Trump about his final campaign. In the article she quoted several anonymous sources who gave an insight on the politician’s post-Presidency life and commented on his bid to run for the White House once again.</p><p>In the report she alleged that a former White House official and Trump loyalist told her that Trump was an “isolated figure” who did not want to run for the White House, but announced his bid to “prove the haters wrong.”</p><p>Other sources allegedly claimed that trump mostly stays in his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, and only leaves home to play golf at his club in Doral.</p><p>“He just goes, plays golf, comes back, and f***s off. He has retreated to the golf course and to Mar-a-Lago. His world has gotten much smaller. His world is so, so small.”</p><p>She also wrote that an advisor who works on Trump’s ongoing campaign allegedly told her that the politician’s appeal was “gone” and that he cannot get it back in the future:</p><p>“It’s not there. In this business, you can have it and have it so hot and it can go overnight and it’s gone and you can’t get it back. I think we’re just seeing it’s gone. The magic is gone.”</p><p>In the article, she said that she spoke with Donald Trump in an interview but he allegedly denied all claims made by the insiders.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=donald-trump-response></span>Donald Trump Response<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Donald Trump made a response about the article claiming it was all fake and termed Nuzzi’s sources as non-existence.</p><p>“The Fake & Corrupt News is only getting worse! As an example, I agreed to do a short telephone interview for a once very good, but now on its “last legs” and failing, New York Magazine. The reporter was a shaky & unattractive wack job, known as “tough” but dumb as a rock, who actually wrote a decent story about me a long time ago. Her name, Olivia Nuzzi. Anyway, the story was Fake News, her “anonymous sources” don’t exist (true with many writers), and I’m happily fighting hard for our GREAT USA!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-salary></span>Olivia Nuzzi Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her annual base salary is estimated to be $87,456.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-net-worth></span>Olivia Nuzzi Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynnLBlqaS%2FrHnMmp6aspmjsm6%2BxKmmq6yVp3qwuMivoJplnqrHu7WMoqpmq5iaeq6t0augnpxdZ3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-new-york-magazine-reporter-olivia-nuzzi-is-she-married-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-new-york-magazine-reporter-olivia-nuzzi-is-she-married-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-new-york-magazine-reporter-olivia-nuzzi-is-she-married-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-new-york-magazine-reporter-olivia-nuzzi-is-she-married-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-new-york-magazine-reporter-olivia-nuzzi-is-she-married-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-new-york-magazine-reporter-olivia-nuzzi-is-she-married-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-swifties-think-a-reputation-tv-announcement-is-imminent.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-swifties-think-a-reputation-tv-announcement-is-imminent.html>Why Swifties Think a 'Reputation (TV)' Announcement Is Imminent</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-ashley-ozsan-hal-ozsan-wife-meet-the-couple-on-instagram-236553-html.html>Who Is Ashley Ozsan- Hal Ozsan Wife?
