Born on September 25, 1975, Diao would have been 48 years old in 2023.</p><p>A native of Heilongjiang Province, she was raised in an environment that fostered her academic aspirations. Diao was the beloved daughter of caring parents who instilled in her the virtues of hard work and integrity. Diao’s insatiable thirst for knowledge led her to the prestigious Nanjing University, where she was enrolled in the university’s highly competitive Science program.</p><p>She was considered a diligent and focused student by her peers and faculty. Regrettably, her promising journey was abruptly halted by her unforeseen disappearance in January 1996, an event that shook the nation and is still talked about nearly three decades later.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=When_did_Diao_Aiqing_disappear><strong>When did Diao Aiqing disappear?</strong></span></h3><p>A soul of quiet simplicity, often shrouded herself in solitude, preferring her company to the crowd. On the evening of January 10, 1996, her world took an unexpected turn. Diao and her roommate had been reprimanded for the illicit use of an electric appliance in their dormitory.</p><p>A disagreement ensued with the dormitory supervisors, and Diao, donning a red coat lined in black, stepped out into the chill of the night, her return forever pending. While her disappearance was immediately reported, the news reached her family nine days later, on January 19.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=What_happened_to_Diao_Aiqing><strong>What happened to Diao Aiqing?</strong></span></h3><p>In the icy throes of January 19, a sanitation worker stumbled upon an unexpected and gruesome discovery. Inside a bag initially mistaken for containing pork, the worker unearthed pieces of human flesh, the grim reality of which only became evident upon the unsettling find of three human fingers.</p><p>Upon investigation, the authorities were promptly informed and verified the chilling truth that the bag contained human remains. In the wake of this alarming revelation, the search began for the rest of the victims, and Nanjing was awash with a wave of dread.</p><p>Over time, plastic-wrapped parcels of human remnants were uncovered from eight locations near the university, including the stadium, entrance gate, and hospital, and scattered alongside roads. By January 30, a disturbing trail of evidence had led to the victim’s identification – it was Diao Aiqing.</p><p>Her dismembered head and clothing were recovered, and her father was asked to journey to Nanjing. Once a sanctuary of learning, the city had transformed into a chilling crime scene.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=When_and_Where_Was_Diao_Aiqing_Last_Seen><strong>When and Where Was Diao Aiqing Last Seen?</strong></span></h3><p>In a chilling twist that sent ripples of trepidation through the community, the Yangtse Evening Post circulated a haunting image of Diao, her hair styled in a boyish cut.</p><p>The narrative that surrounded her last sighting was even more disquieting. Clad in a red coat, Diao had seemingly vanished into thin air. This information ignited a fear that gripped the community to its core. The unsettling possibility of a predator preying on short-haired women adorned in red coats had the city teetering on the brink of panic.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Investigation_and_Autopsy_Report><strong>Investigation and Autopsy Report</strong></span></h3><p>The officer admitted that the intricate dissection of the flesh pieces was chilling in precision. Such expert incisions, they concluded, could only be accomplished by a person possessing a complex understanding of human anatomy.</p><p>Their immediate suspect pool thus included individuals who were professional butchers or surgeons. The suspicion inevitably fell on the university students and faculty. Profilers suggested two possible individuals – one of which was a physically fit, middle-aged man who lived alone. However, the investigation met with a dead-end, as no such individual could be found within the university community.</p><p>Despite an exhaustive search in and around the university, no significant leads emerged, and the case was left gasping for breath. In 2016, a glimmer of hope was offered to Diao’s family as the Nanjing police assured them that the case was still “under investigation.”</p><p><strong>We wrap up our scrutiny by stating</strong>&nbsp;that the enigmatic circumstances of Her disappearance and tragic end continue to bewilder us, even after several years.</p><p>In light of our findings, we underline the importance of persistent investigation in ensuring that justice is eventually served for She and all victims of such heinous acts.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></h3><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Diao Aiqing?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Diao was a Chinese student at Nanjing University who mysteriously disappeared in 1996 and was later found brutally murdered.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>When did Diao Aiqing disappear?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>She disappeared on the evening of January 10, 1996, after a dispute over a dormitory rule violation at Nanjing University.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Where was Diao Aiqing last seen?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>She was last seen at her dormitory at Nanjing University, dressed in a red coat.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>What happened to Diao Aiqing?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>She was brutally murdered, and her dismembered remains were scattered across eight Nanjing University locations.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who were the suspects in Diao Aiqing’s case?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Investigators suspected that the killer might have been a professional butcher or surgeon due to the precision of the dissection.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Is Diao Aiqing’s case still open?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>As of the latest update, Her case is still “under investigation,” as stated by Nanjing police in 2016.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Why is Diao Aiqing’s case significant?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Her case remains one of China’s most chilling unsolved murder mysteries.
