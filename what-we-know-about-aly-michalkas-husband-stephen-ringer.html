However, her husband is a director, so he is mostly behind the scenes, but unlike Stephen Spielberg or Martin Scorsese, he is not as popular.</p><p>The couple tends to live a pretty private life, even though they are both famous. Ringer is so private in fact that his Instagram feed is just filled with photos of others and scenery, including his wife and sister-in-law. Not too much is known about him, so we figured we would compile what we do know all into one place.</p><p>Here's what we know about Aly Michalka's husband, Stephen Ringer.</p><h2 id=stephen-ringer-39-s-early-life><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Stephen Ringer's Early Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stephen Ringer was born on December 12, 1984, in Dallas, Texas, which makes him 37 years old. Not too much is known about his childhood. However, Aly has tagged photos of him with his mother's account, and we know her name is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kitty Ringer.</a> Before he became a cinematographer/director/producer, Ringer was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photojournalist, gaffer and camera seeker.</a></p><h2 id=stephen-ringer-39-s-relationship-with-aly-michalka><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Stephen Ringer's Relationship With Aly Michalka</span></h2><p>In 2013, Ringer and Michalka began dating after meeting on the set of Sequoia.

Michalka wore a lavender gown and of course, her sister, was her maid of honor. This year will mark nine years since Ringer and Michalka have been together and seven years since they've been married. They do not have any children. If it wasn't for Aly's Instagram, fans might not ever get an update.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Disney Channel's Aly And AJ?</a></span></p><h2 id=stephen-ringer-39-s-career><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Stephen Ringer's Career</span></h2><p>Stephen Ringer is a cinematographer, director and producer.

"It's really important to have a script that has elements in it that will appeal to people. We saw finding funding as a way to test whether or not the film would find an audience because if you can convince people to fund the movie, then you can convince people to watch it. If no one wants to put money into it, it's also an indication that you may struggle to find an audience. Aly and AJ already have an audience because they have fans, but we also knew that their relationship and chemistry is so electric that if you could just get it on screen, people would relate to it," he said.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How TikTok Helped Aly And AJ Michalka Have A Major Career Comeback</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMmqOyZZ2esKmty6SYrGWYqsCjrc2dZKyslaW1prqMq6Cnn5WnfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-we-know-about-aly-michalkas-husband-stephen-ringer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-we-know-about-aly-michalkas-husband-stephen-ringer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-aly-michalkas-husband-stephen-ringer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-we-know-about-aly-michalkas-husband-stephen-ringer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-aly-michalkas-husband-stephen-ringer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-aly-michalkas-husband-stephen-ringer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-all-americans-actor-hunter-clowdus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-all-americans-actor-hunter-clowdus.html>Who Is All Americans Actor, Hunter Clowdus?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-between-liam-payne-and-louis-tomlinson.html>What Happened Between One Direction Stars Liam Payne And Louis Tomlinson?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-between-liam-payne-and-louis-tomlinson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
