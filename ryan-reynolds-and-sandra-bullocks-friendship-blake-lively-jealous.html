Is the Gossip Girl star jealous of Reynolds and Bullock's connection or does she support the famous actress? Keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=did-ryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullock-date>Did Ryan Reynolds And Sandra Bullock Date?</h2><p>According to Who's Dated Who, Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">linked to each other back in 2011</a>. As fans know, the two played love interests in the 2009 rom-com The Proposal — and they always only said nice things about each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Proposal definitely has a couple of scenes for which the two actors had to get up close and personal, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock admitted that that wasn't easy at all</a>. "Ryan and I have known each other since we were prepubescent. We go way, way, way back. We had to do the naked scene that day and Anne Fletcher, our director who's just incredible, she's great. So, we had a closed set, which means no one's allowed to be on there, just hair and makeup coming in to fluff and hide," Bullock revealed. "Ryan and I have these flesh-colored things stuck to our privates, my hair is strategically over the nipples, and Ryan's little— not little, at all! It's just whatever's there, and I don't know because I didn't see it, I didn't look! When they'd say cut, we couldn't really move. He was on his back with his knees up, and I'm on the floor just sort of resting on his knees, just waiting, and you don't wanna look and we couldn't really move. Then I hear Anne Fletcher from the darkness go, 'Ryan, we can see your ball sack!' I'm like, 'Oh God!' because you wanna look down but I'm like, 'Don't look down. Don't look down.' ... Everyone in the darkness spun around to see if they could find a monitor. I was like, 'Anne, there's a way to present that information...'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="According To Sandra Bullock, This Is What Working With Daniel Radcliffe Is Really Like">According To Sandra Bullock, This Is What Working With Daniel Radcliffe Is Really Like</a></span></p><p>However, even though the two have been linked to each other, neither of them ever confirmed being anything more than friends. "I think there will be a collective sigh amongst women in the United States when I say he’s not my lover. He’s just an amazing friend I’ve had for ten years. I don’t get his loving after dark," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock revealed</a> on the Today Show.</p><p>Ryan Reynolds has revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and Bullock would love to star in another project together</a>. "We've talked about it. We had such great chemistry [in that film] — that was based on 10 years of friendship. We had known each other for a long time when we went into that. If it's the right [project], we'll do it because it's like working with family. It's a great experience," Reynolds said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-blake-lively-feel-about-ryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullock-39-s-friendship>How Does Blake Lively Feel About Ryan Reynolds And Sandra Bullock's Friendship?</h2><p>According to the National Enquirer, Reynolds' wife Blake Lively isn't happy about his friendship with Bullock at all. "He’s known to have a huge soft spot for Sandra and lights up whenever she comes up in conversation. It’s obvious she holds a special place in his heart," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the source said</a>. "And Blake isn’t thrilled about it. She doesn’t think anything’s going on, but she’s concerned the sparks are ready to fly again. She knows how attracted Ryan is to Sandy. It’s obvious by the way he fawns over her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While guest starring on The Tonight Show, Blake Lively admitted that seeing her husband in intimate scenes with other women isn't easy at all. "I was on the plane with my baby, James. It’s kind of torture these days because I’m on a plane, and everywhere I look, every screen is my husband in a sex montage throughout the holidays with another woman because everybody wants to watch Deadpool on the plane. Everyone," Blake said. It's safe to say that the actress wouldn't enjoy watching The Proposal.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Blake Lively Vs.

Ryan Reynolds almost starred alongside Sandra Bullock in <a href=#>the 2022 action-adventure movie The Lost City</a>, however, the filmmakers ended up casting Channing Tatum. Ryan Reynolds ended up promoting the movie on his Instagram profile, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and his wife Blake Lively even watched it together during a fun date night</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="How Sandra Bullock Stays In Shape At 57 Years Old">How Sandra Bullock Stays In Shape At 57 Years Old</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYr%2Bmxc2oo52rXZa7pXnSmqWdqpFir7a4y6iapKtdm7%2Bqsc2dqqGhoGKvra3KnmSloaaaubp5yZ6YpaelqHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullocks-friendship-blake-lively-jealous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullocks-friendship-blake-lively-jealous.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullocks-friendship-blake-lively-jealous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullocks-friendship-blake-lively-jealous.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullocks-friendship-blake-lively-jealous.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-sandra-bullocks-friendship-blake-lively-jealous.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-kelces-trainer-taped-his-ankles-1-last-time-amid-cancer-battle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-kelces-trainer-taped-his-ankles-1-last-time-amid-cancer-battle.html>Jason Kelce's Trainer Taped His Ankles 1 Last Time Amid Cancer Battle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hirving-lozano-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Hirving Lozano Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hirving-lozano-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
