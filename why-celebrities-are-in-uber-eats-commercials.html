For instance, there is<strong> </strong><a href=#>Jason Momoa looking as hunky as ever in a Harley Davidson commercial</a>. And who can forget Brad Pitt going on a coffee bean run for De’Longhi?</p><p>In recent years, Uber Eats has also been utilizing a lot of celebrity power, featuring the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Trevor Noah, Nick Braun, and Jennifer Coolidge. The company even has them eating some inedible stuff.</p><h2 id=uber-has-long-recognized-the-power-of-celebrity-involvement>Uber Has Long Recognized The Power Of Celebrity Involvement</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Uber Eats has been coming up with the most viral celeb-led ads for some time now. For instance, it tapped Kim Kardashian, Naomi Watts, Rebel Wilson, and Ruby Rose for a series of ads catering to its Australian market. Meanwhile, for its Super Bowl 2021 ad, the company reunited Wayne’s World alums Mike Myers and Dana Carvey for a campaign that encourages viewers to eat local. The stars were even joined by Cardi B.</p><p>For 2022, Uber Eats decided to combine celebrity power with a little self-deprecating humor. And with the help of ad agencies Special US and Special Australia, it seems they’ve come up with the perfect excuse to show Paltrow tasting her own This Smells Like My Vagina candle and Coolidge eating a lipstick. After all, it’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the best way to let people know that there’s more to Uber Eats than food deliveries</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“After our Super Bowl debut in 2021, we’re thrilled to return for year two with a campaign that highlights everything you can order on Uber Eats – even if you can’t eat it,” Georgie Jeffreys, Uber Eats’ head of marketing in U.S. and Canada, explained. “Our Super Bowl campaign places our ‘Don’t Eats’ at the heart of the creative with a humorous twist thanks to our star-studded cast.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is The Original Jake From State Farm Still Alive?</a></span></p><p>Since their release, the ads have certainly created a lot of buzz. And while viewers may have had some mixed reactions to them, celebrities seem to have a good reason for participating in this type of absurd comedy.</p><h2 id=here-39-s-why-celebs-are-appearing-in-uber-eats-commercials>Here's Why Celebs Are Appearing In Uber Eats Commercials</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, celebrities are certainly getting paid a lot of money to do Uber Eats commercials (reports indicate that Kardashian was paid around $1.3 million to $2 million for her Uber Eats Australia stint). But it seems these stars aren’t just doing the ads for the money.</p><p>For instance<strong>, </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paltrow has been a longtime fan of Uber Eats</a>, even back when it didn’t offer ‘Don’t Eats.’</p><p>“We actually order from Goop Kitchen — in Studio City and on the west side in Santa Monica — through Uber Eats a lot,” the actress revealed. “[My husband] Brad [Falchuk] literally orders Goop Kitchen for lunch every single day. Otherwise, we do more local spots — there's a taco place my daughter [Apple] loves and [my son] Moses tends to order, like, a hot chicken sandwich from somewhere.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And just like the rest of the U.S. the A-lister only learned about ‘Don’t Eats’ on Uber Eats quite recently. “I just found out that you can order not food on Uber Eats!” she explained. “So I'm gonna be implementing that into my routine.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Milana Vayntrub Before Becoming The AT&T Girl?</a></span></p><p>As for Coolidge, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she may have initially thought that Uber ‘Don’t Eats’ on Uber Eats was a joke</a>. “When they told me they wanted to do this, I thought it was a crank phone call!” the actress remarked. “But it’s been so great working with Uber Eats because they’ve really made this into a great business.”</p><p>Just like Paltrow, the 2 Broke Girls alum also had no idea that Uber Eats also offered non-food items before partnering up with the company. And now, Coolidge has been using the service more and more simply because it’s so convenient. In fact, the actress revealed that her household has “been using it like a storm” as she continues to invite people over in between her Zoom meetings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You can get anything; you can get the dog food, feminine products ... you can actually send someone out for flowers and candles, and they'll show up before your people arrive,” Coolidge explained. And whenever she feels the need to order small items like makeup, the actress also decides to make the most out of her order by stocking up on certain non-food essentials too.</p><p>“So you add things to your order like trash bags that you know you'll need down the line. Open my closet, and you'll see, I really do have trash bags for days.”</p><p>Now, viewers may still have mixed feelings about seeing their favorite stars eat everything from candles to deodorant on tv. Nonetheless, one thing’s for sure. Uber Eats certainly drove it’s ‘Don’t Eats’ message home.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Does Jake From State Farm Have A Future In Acting After His Insurance Gig?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLKtscGroK2hlah6or7EZqCnZaWXsrN5xJqrrGWTpLqusdGcoJqko2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-celebrities-are-in-uber-eats-commercials.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-didnt-shivon-zilis-twins-have-elon-musk-name-at-birth.html>Why Didn't Shivon Zilis Give Her Twins Elon Musk's Last Name At Birth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-voices-joel-in-the-last-of-us-video-game.html>Who Voices Joel In The Last Of Us Video Game?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-voices-joel-in-the-last-of-us-video-game.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
