Theresa and William shared son <strong>Tommy</strong> and daughter <strong>Jen</strong>.</p><p class=p1>Theresa’s family has been supportive of <a href=#>her Bachelor Nation journey</a>. Jen even gave her mom some words of wisdom ahead of the <i>Golden Bachelor </i>premiere.</p><p class=p1>&nbsp;“BE YOURSELF. How awesome that so many people in the world are going to get to ‘know’ you! You are one of a kind and have so much goodness to share. Don’t be anything other than exactly you,” Jen gushed via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in September 2023. “Have fun. Laugh. I hope I get to hear a real Theresa laugh on the show! … You are wonderful. You’ve got this. Kiss him if it feels right.

While Gerry was stunned by her limo exit, it was revealed that she was actually wearing a nude-colored minidress.</p><p class=p1>After getting a rose at the rose ceremony, Theresa was <a href=#>the first contestant to be invited on a one-on-one date</a>.

Theresa, however, continually asserted that she did not understand why Kathy had been upset with her.</p><p class=p1>“Never in a million years did I think that I was going to find myself involved in drama. That is so not who I am,” <a href=#>she wrote via Instagram in October 2023</a>. “I just thought that I was able to be open and honest with a new friend about how I was feeling. As you saw, I acknowledged that everyone felt a connection to Gerry, and I welcomed that. We were all on a journey to see who was the best fit for Gerry.”</p><p class=p1>Theresa noted: “I never ever intended to make Kathy or anyone feel less than. As <strong>Edith [Aguirre]</strong> said, ‘It’s the tension that we’re dating just one man.’ Of course!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Golden-Bachelor-Theresa-Nist-5-Things-5.jpg><h3 class=p5><b>Has Theresa Nist Been Married Before?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></b></h3><p class=p1>Theresa and William, nicknamed Billy, were <a href=#>high school sweethearts</a>.
