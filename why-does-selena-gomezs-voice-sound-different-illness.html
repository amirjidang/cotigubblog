In June 2022, the show premiered its second season, and only a month later it was renewed for a third one. For her role, Selena Gomez received critical praise, and she has even been nominated for a Critics' Choice Television Award in the category Best Actress in a Comedy Series.</p><p>While there is no doubt that her portrayal of Mabel Mora is some of the most significant work in Selena Gomez's career, fans have been quick to notice that there is something different about the former Disney Channel star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/selena-gomez-s-famous-boyfriends-ranked-by-net-worth-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Selena Gomez's Famous Ex Boyfriends Ranked By Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A lot of outlandishly wealthy men have won Selena's heart, but which is actually the wealthiest?</span><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A user on Reddit</a> pointed out that the actress' voice seems to have changed since her days on Wizards of Waverly Place.</p><p>"Does anyone else think Selena Gomez’s voice sounds super weird in this show?" the Redditor asked.

Just me, or did anyone else notice this?"</p><p>While many answered that the voice change is most likely connected to the fact that Selena Gomez has aged — after all, the actress was only 15 when she began playing Alex Russon on the show — that might not be the only reason she sounds different today.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-was-diagnosed-with-lupus-between-2012-and-early-2014>Selena Gomez Was Diagnosed With Lupus Between 2012 And Early 2014</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/spl9942848_001.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former Disney Channel star was diagnosed with lupus between 2012 and early 2014. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lupus is "an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks its own tissues, causing widespread inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs. It can affect the joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels. There is no cure for lupus, but medical interventions and lifestyle changes can help control it."</p><p>In September 2017, Selena Gomez revealed on her Instagram that she had to receive a kidney transplant as a result of her lupus — and <a href=#>a kidney was successfully transplanted to her from actress and friend Francia Raisa</a>. Over the years, Gomez has opened up about her lupus calling it an "everyday struggle."</p><p>In an interview with Elle, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gomez opened up about how lupus affects her</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I experienced that with my weight fluctuation for the first time. I have lupus and deal with kidney issues and high blood pressure so I deal with a lot of health issues and for me that’s when I really started noticing more of the body image stuff," the actress said.</p><p>"No, [the lupus doesn’t affect my weight]; it’s the combination of all of it. It’s the medication I have to take for the rest of my life—it depends on even the month, to be honest. So for me, I really noticed when people started attacking me for that. In reality, that’s just my truth. I fluctuate. It depends what’s happening in my life. Right [it's totally out of my control], and that got to me big time. I think for me, that really messed me up for a bit."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/every-plastic-surgery-selena-gomez-has-been-accused-of-having-and-whether-or-not-there-s-is-legitimacy-to-the-rumor.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Selena Gomez's Outrageous Real Estate Portfolio Proves Her Net Worth May Be Far Larger Than Her Fans Realize</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Even though it is no secret that Selena Gomez is very successful, her massive real estate empire proves she is richer than most people realize.</span><p>While it's clear that lupus hasn't been easy to live with, the former Disney Channel star is making sure she keeps herself as healthy as possible.
