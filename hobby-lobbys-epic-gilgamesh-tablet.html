The subject of the story has been a continual source of&nbsp;justification&nbsp;for groups ranging from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">conspiracy theorists</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">religious institutions</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">linguists</a> around the world. It is used as a confirmation&nbsp;of their histories, their relevance, and some of their most outlandish beliefs. Its significance and cultural esteem has placed it as one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most valuable treasures of the ancient world</a> and one edition of the work, titled the "Gilgamesh Dream Tablet" was recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seized from Hobby Lobby</a> by the United States Justice Department.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>25 Unusual Ancient Items We Still Can't Explain Today</a></span></p><p>Hobby Lobby purchased the tablets containing sections from the Epic of Gilgamesh from a Christie's auction back in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 for $1,674,000</a>. The piece was intended to be added to Hobby Lobby's growing museum in Washington D.C. The Museum of the Bible, a foundation&nbsp;funded&nbsp;by Hobby Lobby owner David Green. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2019</a>, a notification was sent to the museum, alerting them of the illegal shipping history of the tablet and in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">July of 2021, </a>the US Justice Department reached out to Hobby Lobby, ordering the companies forfeiture of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.6 million tablet</a>. In response, Hobby Lobby has now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filed its own lawsuit</a> against Christie's auction house, claiming Christie's&nbsp;knew of the illegally transported artifact.</p><h2 id=avoiding-customs>Avoiding Customs</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hobby Lobby lawsuit against Christie's auction house claims that the organization knew of the illegal nature behind the tablets prior to&nbsp;their sale. The tablet is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">3,600 year old artifact</a> that was snuck into the US <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2003</a>. The suit follows Hobby Lobby's recent forfeiture of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over 3,800 artifacts</a> from ancient Iraq including multiple cuneiform tablets that were disguised as '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tile samples</a>' during their shipments. Hobby Lobby's controversial ownership of illegal items&nbsp;was first discovered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2017</a> when the company was fined <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $3 million</a> for harboring stolen artifacts from both Iraq and Egypt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The illegal nature of the items stems from a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1990s decision by the US Justice Department</a> to ban looted imports from Iraq with cultural and archeological significance. After its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2003 arrival</a>, the tablet was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold by a Jordanian dealer</a> living in London for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$50,000</a> to another anonymous dealer. It is still unclear how many times the tablet has traded hand and been sold. It was listed at Christie's auction by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph David Hackmey</a>, an Israeli business man and art collector who convinced the auction house to&nbsp;move forward with the sale. As the lawsuit unfolds between Hobby Lobby and Christie's auction house, the US has already shipped the ancient tablet back to Iraq, as part of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17,000-item shipment</a>. Hasan Nadhim, the culture minister of Iraq, stated that the shipment was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the largest reparation in the history of Iraq.</a></p><h2 id=museum-of-the-bible>Museum of the Bible</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Originally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">founded in late 2017</a>, the Washington D.C.-based museum contains iterations and editions of the Bible throughout history. The museum has endured a variety of controversy since its opening ranging from the forfeiture of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over 3,800 artifacts</a> to questions over some of the museum's collections authenticity.</p><p>Prior to the museums opening, the Green family acquired <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Dead Sea Scrolls</a>. The subject of the scrolls&nbsp;features&nbsp;some of the lost books of the Bible&nbsp;such as the highly-controversial Book of Enoch. The scrolls were originally discovered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 1946</a> and had an estimated value of over <a href=#>$1.2 billion</a>. With the rarity of the items and expensive price tag, the authenticity of the documents held by the museum was often questioned. After Hobby Lobby sent the items off to Germany to to test their authenticity, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">five of them</a> were determined to be fakes. Further testing from professionals proved that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> all 16 of the Dead Sea Scrolls housed by the Museum of the Bible were fakes</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another object of contention were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">11 stolen Bible fragments</a> that the museum had acquired through MacArthur Fellowship 'Genius Grant' winner Professor Dirk Obbink. A professor known for his work with Oxford University's Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project, Obbink sold the pieces to Hobby Lobby which were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden by secret doors</a> and viewable <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only through a Non Disclosure Agreement</a>. All objects were later found to be stolen and ordered to be returned to Iraq.</p><h2 id=hidden-treasures-of-the-ancient-world>Hidden Treasures of the Ancient World</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hidden treasures from past-cultures and civilizations can fetch high prices at auction houses throughout the world. The treasures can range from buried items found underground to treasures kept under lock-and-key for generations. One such example is the treasure discovered at a Hindu temple in Trivandrum, India which included <a href=#>over $22 billion</a> in gold coins, jewels, and solid gold statues depicting gods and goddesses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another tablet that rivals the wealth attached to the ancient Epic of Gilgamesh is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosetta Stone</a>. The piece of granodiorite stele is inscribed with Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and Ancient Greek. The tablet established a code system for deciphering Egyptian scripts which later contributed to an unimaginable understanding of culture. Originally discovered in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosetta, Egypt in 1799</a>, the object now resides in the British Museum. Requests from Egypt to have the stone returned home have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">continuously denied</a>.</p><p>With ancient tablets and scriptures fetching high sums at auction houses, it's no surprise that the items often turn out to be stolen, forged, or imitations of the originals. And with a museum dedicated to one of the most culturally-significant books of all time, it isn't too shocking to find themselves in controversial law suits over the objects. But whether the museum has engaged in illegal trading knowingly, or, if they have been duped by their desire to collect some of the most culturally-sensitive artifacts of all time still remains a mystery. One equally as engaging as the thousand-year-old mystery of who truly composed some of these ancient tablets to begin with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>25 Long Lost Ancient Items That Were Discovered (And Their Worth)</a></span></p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYPost</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WashingtonPost</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtNews</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGuardian</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BusinessInsider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grunge</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxatic</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenCulture</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ICR</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">History</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sK7BsmSlp5KXxrR5xKmgnGWXnrmorcyeqqFlpJavrbHTaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhobby-lobbys-epic-gilgamesh-tablet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhobby-lobbys-epic-gilgamesh-tablet.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhobby-lobbys-epic-gilgamesh-tablet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhobby-lobbys-epic-gilgamesh-tablet.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhobby-lobbys-epic-gilgamesh-tablet.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhobby-lobbys-epic-gilgamesh-tablet.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hugh-jackman-fans-impressed-as-he-forgives-mom-who-abandoned-him-as-a-baby.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hugh-jackman-fans-impressed-as-he-forgives-mom-who-abandoned-him-as-a-baby.html>Hugh Jackman Fans Impressed As He Forgives Mom Who Abandoned Him As A Baby</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./heather-dubrow-house-net-worth-properties-real-estate-real-housewives.html>Heres How Much Real Housewives Star Heather Dubrow Has Spent On Her Insane Properties</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./heather-dubrow-house-net-worth-properties-real-estate-real-housewives.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
