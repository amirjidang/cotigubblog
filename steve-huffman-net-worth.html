As of April 2023, Steve Huffman estimated net worth is above $5 million. His net worth includes his investments in various companies such as Hipmunk and Breadpig.</p><p>Steve Huffman is a prominent American tech entrepreneur who co-founded the social networking site, Reddit.com, with his college roommate, <a href=#>Alexis Ohanian</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, they came up with the idea for the site while they were both studying at the University of Virginia. They launched Reddit in June 2005, with funding from tech incubator Y Combinator.</p><p>During the early days of Reddit, Huffman was responsible for selecting the content on the site’s front page.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being based out of a modest two-bedroom apartment in Boston, Reddit quickly gained popularity and was purchased by Condé Nast Publications in 2006. The site’s name was changed to Advance Publications to reflect the new ownership.</p><p>As of today, more than 542 million people have visited Reddit in a single month, making it one of the most popular sites on the web.&nbsp;</p><p>When the site was sold to Condé Nast, there were only four <a href=#>employees working for Reddit</a>. However, the company grew rapidly; by July 2017, it had over 230 employees.</p><p>In 2010, Huffman left Reddit to co-found the travel website, Hipmunk with Adam Goldstein. Hipmunk’s mission was to provide travelers with real-time information and data organized in multiple ways.</p><p>However, Huffman returned to Reddit in 2015 after the site experienced a period of upheaval. He succeeded Ellen Pao as CEO and has remained in the role ever since.</p><p>Aside from his work with Reddit and Hipmunk, Huffman has also taught an e-learning course on web development through Udacity.</p><p>Despite his success, Huffman has expressed regret for selling Reddit so early and has admitted that he could never have imagined the site becoming as popular as it is today.</p><p>Steve Huffman is a highly successful tech entrepreneur who has made significant contributions to the development of social networking and online travel booking.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite stepping away from Reddit for a time, he has played a crucial role in shaping the site’s success and popularity.</p><p>With his entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to innovation, it is likely that Huffman will continue to make significant contributions to the tech industry in the years to come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Steve Huffman’s reddit</h2><p>In the spring break of his senior year at the University of Virginia, Steve Huffman embarked on a journey that would eventually lead to the creation of one of the most popular websites on the internet.</p><p>Along with his college roommate, Alexis Ohanian, he traveled to Boston to attend a lecture by programmer-entrepreneur Paul Graham.</p><p>After the lecture, the two stayed behind to chat with Graham about some of their ideas. Impressed by their ideas, Graham invited them to apply to his startup incubator, Y Combinator.</p><p>Initially, Huffman’s idea was for a food ordering service that would allow users to order food via text message. The idea was called My Mobile Menu, but it was ultimately rejected by the incubator.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Graham invited Huffman and Ohanian to come back to Boston to pitch another idea for a start-up.&nbsp;</p><p>It was during this session that the idea for Reddit was formed. Huffman and Ohanian were accepted into Combinator and launched Reddit in June 2005, funded by the incubator.</p><p>Huffman had coded the entire site in Lisp, a family of programming languages. Reddit was designed to be the front page of the internet, allowing users to receive news and interact with each other.</p><p>Within a few months of its launch, Reddit’s audience grew rapidly. By August of 2005, Huffman realized that there were so many users that he no longer needed to populate the front page with content, as the users were doing so themselves.</p><p>In October of 2006, Huffman and Ohanian sold Reddit to Conde Nast for a price between $10 and $20 million. At the time of the sale, Huffman and Ohanian were only 23 years old. Huffman remained with Reddit until 2009 when he left his acting CEO role.</p><p>After leaving Reddit, Huffman took some time off to backpack in Costa Rica, an experience that inspired him to create a travel website.</p><p>In 2010, he co-created Hipmunk with author and software developer Adam Goldstein. Y Combinator also funded the site, and it launched in August of that year, with Huffman serving as the website’s CTO.</p><p>In 2011, Huffman was named to the “Inc.” list of “30 Under 30,” which highlights 30 young professionals worldwide who are making moves and accomplishing impressive and innovative feats in their respective fields.&nbsp;</p><p>Huffman’s accomplishments with Reddit and Hipmunk are a testament to his talent and entrepreneurial spirit, and he continues to be an influential figure in the tech industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal life</h2><p>Steve Huffman was born on November 12, 1983, and grew up in The Plains, Virginia, where he attended Wakefield School. He then pursued his passion for computer science and earned a degree in the field from the University of Virginia.</p><p>Aside from his interest in technology, Huffman is also a survivalist and enjoys spending time in the great outdoors. He has been married to Katie Babiarz for several years.</p><p>In 2015, Huffman made a statement that contentious communities should not be allowed on Reddit. However, in 2016, he found himself in hot water when he was caught manipulating comments from Donald Trump supporters.&nbsp;</p><p>He was accused of being unkind to moderators who supported Trump and eventually admitted his mistake, saying that the entire company did not approve of his actions. Despite this, <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> still has a significant following on the platform.</p><p>Outside of his tech-related ventures, Steve Huffman has an extensive background in multifamily real estate. He has worked in various areas of the industry, including brokerage, ownership, <a href=#>management</a>, and financing.</p><p>&nbsp;He comes from a family of apartment developers, with his father being the late Ray L. Huffman of Huffman Construction. Using his family’s background, Steve has been involved in managing, rehabilitating, financing, and selling apartment buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;He has helped clients close over 300 apartment escrows throughout the western United States. Huffman Properties Inc., based in San Diego, is run by Steve and his son Austin.&nbsp;</p><p>He is also the Co-Managing Partner of Atlas Management Group LLC in San Diego and the managing partner of KHF Holdings LLC.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve is involved in all aspects of apartment ownership across multiple states, managing over 1,000 apartment units in Southern California, Oregon, Arizona, and Missouri.&nbsp;</p><p>He and his wife, Paige Huffman, reside in Carmel Valley. In his free time, he enjoys traveling, snowboarding, playing tennis and golf, and volunteering as the president of two different Home Owners’ Associations and as a Santa Fe Christian School board member in Solana Beach.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2F056tnmWYqrOnucCnZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteve-huffman-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsteve-huffman-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsteve-huffman-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsteve-huffman-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteve-huffman-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-huffman-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./steven-tyler-and-aimee-preston-39-year-age-gap-and-other-facts-about-their-relationship-aerosmith.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./steven-tyler-and-aimee-preston-39-year-age-gap-and-other-facts-about-their-relationship-aerosmith.html>Steven Tyler And Aimee Preston's 39-Year Age Gap, And Other Facts About Their Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./free-people-lookalike-sweater-set-cozy-fall-fashion-amazon.html>Shop This Brand-New Sweater Set That Looks Like Free People</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./free-people-lookalike-sweater-set-cozy-fall-fashion-amazon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
