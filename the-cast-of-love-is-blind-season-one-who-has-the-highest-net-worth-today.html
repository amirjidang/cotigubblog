That said, one can’t argue that its success rate on that front is tenuous, with only two out of the dozen couplings spawned by the show still standing. However, finding true love might not be the only reason to sign up for the iconic reality dating show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While true love might have eluded some season one hopefuls, the notoriety gained from the show seems to have paid off quite handsomely. Most of the debut season’s cast members are making a comfortable living from brand endorsements and sponsorship deals, while <a href=#>others have amassed sizeable fortunes</a> from landing book deals and running successful podcasts/YouTube channels. Here’s a run-down of the biggest names from season one and their current net worths.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will Love Is Blind Season 3 Be Different?</a></span></p><h2 id=cameron-hamilton-2-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Cameron Hamilton ($2 Million)</span></h2><p>Cameron Hamilton is by far the wealthiest Love is Blind alum so far.

These ventures, combined with a well-paying day job, have inflated Cameron’s net worth to a whopping $2 million.</p><h2 id=lauren-speed-hamilton-1-5-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lauren Speed-Hamilton ($1.5 Million)</span></h2><p>Lauren Speed-Hamilton’s net worth has also grown exponentially since her time on Love is Blind lapsed. The 34-year-old has been making serious cash from the joint ventures with her husband.</p><p>In addition, Lauren has leveraged her reality TV fame and sizable social media following to land lucrative brand endorsement and sponsorship deals. The Georgia native also owns her own multimedia company and co-hosts the MTV dating show, Match Me If You Can.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Lauren Speed And Cameron Hamilton's Life After Love Is Blind</a></span></p><h2 id=damian-powers-1-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Damian Powers ($1 Million)</span></h2><p>Although his romance with Giannina Gibelli did not work out, Damian Powers is doing quite well in the financial front.

After his time on the show, Barnes gained close to half a million followers on Instagram, which could come in quite handy when negotiating sponsorship deals.</p><p>Nonetheless, reality TV fame has not significantly altered the 30-year-old’s net worth. Although Barnes occasionally takes sponsorship deals, most of his income comes from his day job.</p><h2 id=giannina-gibelli-500k><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Giannina Gibelli ($500k)</span></h2><p>Giannina Gibelli has amassed a sizable net worth since starring in Love is Blind.
