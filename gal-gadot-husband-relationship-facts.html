Before she was even famous, she'd already&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">served in the Israeli army</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">won Miss Israel</a>. Now, she's one of Hollywood's most bankable actresses, having starred in D.C.'s Wonder Woman&nbsp;while pregnant too, and likes showing us all up&nbsp;with her fancy workout routines as she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">transforms into a real-life superhero</a>. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her private life</a> is the real epic tale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plenty of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities marry outside the Hollywood bubble</a>, but Gadot met Varsan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">before she was Wonder Woman</a>, before she was even famous. The power couple has been together for 15 years now and has constantly shown us they're so adorable and rock-solid with each other. They don't do anything without each other's support, and as they juggle their equally successful careers and their family, which is still growing, they make decisions together.</p><p>But while we wait for a third little Wonder Woman or little Superman (which would help Varsan feel a little less outnumbered), let's take a look at how this superhero-strong couple met.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-was-really-quite-simple>It Was Really Quite Simple</h2><p>According to Women's Health, the couple met "under dreamy circumstances," and they're not wrong. They met at a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coachella-like party in the Israeli desert</a>.</p><p>"We met nearly 10 years ago through mutual friends at this very strange party in the Israeli desert," Gadot explained to Glamour. "It was all about yoga, chakras, and eating healthy — we didn't exactly find ourselves there, but we found each other."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Fans Are Hating On Gal Gadot</a></span></p><p>Gadot was still in the military at the time, and Varsano was already a successful real estate developer in the extremely progressive city of Tel Aviv. In a joint interview with Vogue, Gadot described her husband as "too cool for school" at the time.</p><p>"We were in a very unique laboratory—a desert retreat in the south of Israel," Varsano told Vogue. "And both she and I were at a stage in our lives where we were thinking about what is love and what is a relationship. We started talking at 10 p.m., and we kissed at sunrise, and we held hands on the drive back to Tel Aviv. At that moment, we were just glued together. It was beautiful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Gadot returned home, she knew she wanted to date him, but Varsano had bigger plans already circulating in his mind. By their second date, he knew he wanted to marry her.</p><p>"I think I [knew he was the one], but I was too young to get it," Gadot told Glamour. "He did. He's 10 years older than me. He told me on our second date he was serious and wasn't going to wait more than two years to ask me to marry him. Fast-forward two years; he proposed. We were married in 2008."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gal Gadot Shows Off Her Insanely Toned Abs… Thanks To Her Workout Routine</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This initial "no-nonsense" approach to their romance allowed them to survive all these years later. "Both of us said, 'No games. Let’s just be honest and keep it simple," she said. "I wouldn’t be able to do what I do without him."</p><p>The couple didn't share any specific details about their engagement. Still, after she was asked what her most special piece of jewelry was at an event&nbsp;for Tiffany & Co. in 2008, Gadot said, "The most meaningful [jewelry moment] to me is the first time I wore my wedding ring." She continued to say that Yaron proposed in a "very special way…but I’m going to keep that story to myself."</p><p>The couple tied the knot in 2008, and the next year Gadot was cast in Fast & Furious 4, starting a tumultuous time in the young couple's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-started-a-couple-of-businesses-and-a-family-while-gadot-became-an-international-star>They Started A Couple Of Businesses And A Family... While Gadot Became An International Star</h2><p>When Gadot's acting career started to take the couple to L.A. more frequently, it&nbsp;became exhausting going back and forth from America to Israel, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it inspired Varsano</a>.</p><p>"We wanted to feel at home, which is when we discovered these apartments within a hotel in Los Angeles. It became the inspiration for Yaron's hotel, The Varsano," she explained to TotallyJewish.com in 2011. "I think that Yaron and I make a really good team. I understand his career, and he understands mine. We help each other progress in all areas of life. We're both very career-driven."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gal Gadot's Joss Wheedon Allegations Just Shattered His 'Feminist' Image</a></span></p><p>In 2015, they sold it to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for $26million. This wasn't their only business venture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In between having their girls,&nbsp;Varsano and Gadot decided to move to LA permanently. After he sold all of his real estate properties, he needed to figure out what to do, and his wife helped him figure it out. They are a really great team, as Gadot herself said, so she told him, "You’re a developer. Develop movies."&nbsp;So they started the production company Pilot Wave.</p><p>"Pilot Wave will create content that promotes the perspectives and experiences of unique people and produce impactful stories aimed at igniting the imagination," they told Deadline. Through all this, Varsano was extremely supportive of his wife while raising their two girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=body-h2>"It was my husband who told me: 'Gal, think about what kind of a role model you want to be. If you want to show Alma that she can follow her dreams, that's what you should do, and we will figure out the logistics,'" Gadot recalled.</p><p class=body-h2>We really can't get over how powerful they are as a couple. There's not an instance where they aren't right there for each other, and they handle everything that comes at them with such ease it makes us jealous. But then again, Wonder Woman can wrangle the gnarliest of villains without breaking a sweat, and so can Gadot with the help of her superman.</p><p class=body-h2><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gal Gadot Chopped Off Her Fingertip And Her Husband Had The Most Unexpected Reaction</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiemqRdnK6lu9Nmn66rkpa7pXnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkn5mTqcBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgal-gadot-husband-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./trae-young-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-89707-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./trae-young-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-89707-html.html>Trae Young Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./suri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html>Suri Cruise Is One Of The Richest Kids, Who Else Comes Close To Her $800 Million Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./suri-cruise-is-one-of-the-richest-kids-who-else-comes-close-to-her-800-million-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
