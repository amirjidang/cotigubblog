But the talented cast that included Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario still left plenty of people entertained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film also made close to $200 million at the box office which means that it may not come as a surprise to hear that a sequel is already in the works. But Efron and Daddario may be "training" for that role this upcoming summer on the beach if the rumors are true that the two may be quickly becoming more than friends.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to root for the two to become an item, including potentially getting to see more of their flirtatious nature that has been put on display on Instagram. Not to mention the fact that if they do become an item, you'd be sure to see more of both of them. And after Channing and Jenna Tatum left you wondering if love can still exist in Hollywood, what better couple to cheer for than Efron and Daddario?</p><p>But before you start shipping them too hard, there are also plenty of reasons why they wouldn't work and why they should both be hesitant. Including potential ramifications to the sequel. Which is a concern that becomes more real when you read about Efron's relationships with his former bed buddies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Efron's experience with Disney may lead you to believe in happy endings,&nbsp;so here are 7 reasons why Efron and Daddario should start shacking up&nbsp;but be warned because there are also 8 why they should just stay friends.</p><h2 id=no---the-relationship-may-make-her-like-vanessa><strong>No - The Relationship May Make Her Like Vanessa</strong></h2><p>Zac Efron had a 5-year relationship with Vanessa Hudgens who he met while working on the Disney film High School Musical. But by the end of the relationship, Vanessa Hudgens admitted that she went a little too far off the deep end,</p><p><strong>“I went through a phase when I was really mean because I was so fed up. Girls were running after him, and I was giving them death stares. Then I realized that not what that’s about”, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Hudgens </a>to the New York Times.</strong></p><p>We're glad she realized eventually that she was being destructive, but we wouldn't be surprised if there were still some awkward conversations between Hudgens and Efron that he wouldn't want to replicate anytime soon. And the last thing people may want to see is the lovely Alexandra Daddario turning crazy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daddario's previous relationship included an engagement with her co-star from&nbsp;Percy Jackson, Logan Lerman, but his profile in Hollywood is nothing in comparison to Efron.</p><h2 id=yes---their-sense-of-humors-line-up><strong>Yes - Their Sense Of Humors Line-Up</strong></h2><p>Actors definitely have a stressful life and when you consider Efron's ties to Disney, you can perhaps agree with the belief that he may have an even bigger target on his back. But being able to sit back and laugh with your loved one is one of the best things in the world, something that he would surely do a lot of with Daddario; whose Twitter account has been known to crack people up.</p><p>When talking about her sense of humor in an interview with Marie Claire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daddario stated</a>,</p><p><strong>"I’m a little nonsensical, I’m a little absurd and I don’t take myself too seriously."</strong></p><p>Perhaps also shown by her willingness to impersonate Dwayne Johnson in an interview! Efron has also been open about his own sense of humor, including how it plays into his dating life."A girl can tell I like her when I blush or start telling bad jokes," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted Efron</a> to Glamour magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no---she-is-too-hesitant-for-him><strong>No - She Is Too Hesitant For Him</strong></h2><p>It may be easy to sit at home and put the idea of Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario together in your head. But when Daddario was asked by Women's Health on what her perspective on the world of dating is, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she revealed</a>,</p><p><strong>"I date, but I'm really nervous around boys. I get very tentative."</strong></p><p>Okay, there's nothing wrong with that. Daddario must get approached on a regular basis, and provided Efron doesn't mind making the first move, things should be good to go. But wait, in an interview with Glamour magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Efron&nbsp;explained</a>,&nbsp;"I think it's fine for girls to ask boys out. I actually prefer it." Uh oh, which one is going to jump out of their comfort zone?</p><h2 id=yes---they-have-a-cute-meeting-story><strong>Yes - They Have a Cute Meeting Story</strong></h2><p>One of the most anticipated movies of this past summer was Baywatch. Both Daddario and Efron deserve a lot of credit for the hype that was around the movie. Where they play on-screen lovers and quickly became close friends away from the screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about the opportunity to work with Zac Efron, Daddario <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described him as </a>being "incredibly nice" during a discussion with Us Weekly. While Efron hasn't been as open about his first impressions of Daddario, if he's to live up to that description, we're sure he'd have nothing but amazing things to say about her. Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she also commented</a> to People,</p><p><strong>"He had abs in places I didn't know you could have abs."</strong></p><p>If you love seeing couples fall in love on the set of a movie, which is how both parties had fallen in love previously before finding each other, than this ship is definitely for you.</p><h2 id=no---zac-has-dated-famous-people-and-it-hasn-t-gone-well><strong>No -&nbsp;Zac has dated famous people and it hasn't gone well</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest relationships of Zac Efron's life came when he was dating the model, Sami Miro for close to 2 years. The relationship ended in 2016 and Zac promptly made sure to scrub his social media profiles clean of any mention of her. Something he probably wouldn't have the luxury of doing for Daddario when you consider some of his social media posts are promoting&nbsp;Baywatch, and inevitably,&nbsp;Baywatch 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When an insider for E! was asked on why the two went their separate ways, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they stated</a>,</p><p><strong>"It wasn't an easy breakup. Distance and work schedules got in the way with their relationship and Zac wanted to focus on his career."</strong></p><p>With both Efron and Daddario in the prime of their career, perhaps now is the worst time for them to start&nbsp;up a relationship.</p><h2 id=yes---she-can-keep-him-clean><strong>Yes - She Can Keep Him Clean</strong></h2><p>One of the most important influences in your life is the person that you choose to date. And for Zac Efron, he should definitely do all he can to make sure he is picking a partner that can help keep him away from his past demons.</p><p><strong>This includes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former reports</a> from the DailyMail that talked about Efron's habit of partying for several days straight and engaging in several substances that we're sure Daddario would want no part of.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Efron self-admitted himself to rehab and has since 2013, having an extra positive influence in his life in the form of Daddario is still something that is worth rooting for.&nbsp;Though to be fair, this could also backfire as Efron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has also been spotted</a> getting all up on the business of past potential partners including Michelle Rodriguez.</p><h2 id=no---he-wants-to-get-married-but-does-she><strong>No - He Wants To Get Married, But Does She?</strong></h2><p>If you're going to start cheering for Zac and Alexandra to start holding each other tight at night, you might first want to take a moment to evaluate where each of their heads are at.</p><p>Sure, they're 32 and 30 (Zac being the older) but they do seem to be at different places. Whereas Daddario once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted to PEOPLE</a>,</p><p><strong>“It feels really surreal — as a teenager, I could never really get guys and I was pretty nerdy. Now I feel like I’m getting my revenge by being a <i>Baywatch</i> babe. I’m like, ‘You could have had this and now look at me."</strong></p><p>Which sounds like the type of girl who is ready to go and get her flirt and date on to make up for lost time. Zac has always been a heartthrob and linked to beautiful women, but has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocalized to Cosmopolitan</a> about where his head is at.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I didn’t think much about settling down until recently. Now that I’m getting closer to my 30s, I’m around some great relationships and I’ve seen expert couples at work.”</p><p>Zac was 29 at the time of the interview, which means his "marriage clock" may be ticking all the quicker.</p><h2 id=yes---they-already-finish-each-other-s-sentences><strong>Yes - They&nbsp;Already Finish Each Other's Sentences&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Being an actor in a big-budget film like&nbsp;Baywatch&nbsp;definitely means that there are many long days on the set where you get the opportunity to bond with your co-stars. Efron and Daddario showed just how similar the two were when they sat down for an interview together with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">television show</a>&nbsp;The Project, Efron mentioned how dieting for&nbsp;Baywatch&nbsp;led to him craving unusual things.</p><p>Leading Daddario to state,</p><p><strong>"Like, you're laying in bed and you haven't had carbohydrates in five days, and you're just like, I really want…"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before they both chimed in to say "fried pickles". Looks like we know what type of food Efron should bring by the trailer if Daddario is ever having a particularly long day on set for the sequel!</p><h2 id=no---efron-isn-t-friends-with-his-ex-s><strong>No - Efron Isn't Friends With His Ex's</strong></h2><p>When a relationship ends, it may be incredibly hard (and in many cases, not beneficial) to try and remain on close-terms with your partner. But for people who were heartbroken when Disney sweethearts Efron and Hudgens called it quits, perhaps they could take solace that in a relationship that lasted years, that they may have been able to remain friends.</p><p><strong>But Hudgens slammed the door shut on that potential reality when she later admitted in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access Hollywood Live</a> that the two of them have completely lost contact with one another.</strong></p><p>While it's possible that Efron and Daddario would have the right chemistry to go the distance, it's also perhaps more likely that their relationship would flame out. And if Hudgens is any indication, that may also lead to the end of any relationship that Daddario has with Efron.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yes---we-d-get-to-see-more-of-them><strong>Yes - We'd Get To See More Of Them</strong></h2><p>There is no question that the world can't seem to get enough of Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron. Even though they've both put out movies that haven't exactly lived up to expectations, people are still sure to give them another shot and check out whatever ventures they have coming up.</p><p><strong>One of the reasons why people may start cheering for Daddario and Efron to make it as a couple&nbsp;is&nbsp;because it would inevitably lead to an increased chance that the tabloids can provide us inside scoops as to how they're doing.</strong></p><p>We have already seen a small snap of how that would look like when a recent trip out to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pet store</a> by the two of them was photographed. Not to mention doubling the chances that Daddario or Efron will get to attend a red carpet event!</p><h2 id=no---if-it-ends-it-d-make-the-sequel-awkward><strong>No - If It Ends It'd</strong><strong> Make The Sequel Awkward</strong></h2><p>Regardless of your thoughts on the first Baywatch, cash is the final deciding factor in Hollywood and the $177 million that the film took home made it an easy decision to green-light a sequel for Paramount.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>But considering the film includes a relationship and flirty banter between Efron and Daddario's character, the idea of the two of them becoming more than friends away from the screen may make some fans plenty nervous.</strong></p><p>Especially if the relationship ends on awkward terms. And considering they haven't even started filming yet, that's very possible and is just added pressure to the relationship.</p><p>That being said, if they aren't already engaging in some private time together, getting to spend a few months on the beach filming the sequel is sure to not hurt their chances.</p><h2 id=yes---they-only-have-films-in-post-production><strong>Yes - They Only Have Films In Post-Production</strong></h2><p>Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron both have several movies that are scheduled to come out over the next little while. This includes Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile which sees Zac Efron step into the horrifying shoes of one of the worst serial killers of all-time, Ted Bundy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Zac also appears in a comedy starring Matthew McConaughey and Snoop Dogg titled The Beach Bum.</strong></p><p>Talk about two different things! But after he spent months preparing to be Bundy, perhaps hanging out with Snoop Dogg for a few after was just what the "doctor" ordered. Daddario stars with Nathan Fillion and Henry Cavill in an action-thriller, Nomis.</p><p>Which means they both have a lot of press ahead of them, but no days on the set. What better time than now to try and forge a relationship?</p><h2 id=no---but-then-how-can-you-date-them><strong>No -&nbsp;But Then How Can You Date Them?</strong></h2><p>There are many different "dream" couples out there that people would love to see get together. When Alexandra Daddario dated and later got engaged to her costar Logan Lerman from the Percy Jackson franchise, people were ecstatic. But this just made them all the more&nbsp;upset when their relationship fell apart.</p><p><strong>We're sure there are many people 'shipping Daddario and Efron, but we're sure there are also plenty of people out there that would love to see them with someone else.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heck, celebrities aren't immune from dating "regular" people so maybe keeping the two of them single and ready to mingle allows you to keep the fantasy in your head that you're going to be able to win one of them over. You may also cheer for others like musician Rita Ora who has shown chemistry with Efron in the past to perhaps be the person who is sliding into his DM's.</p><h2 id=yes---they-ve-flirted-over-social-media><strong>Yes - They've Flirted Over Social Media&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest reasons why people are so adamant that Daddario and Efron may be&nbsp;together is because of their interactions over Instagram. Because that's just how tabloid journalism works in this era!</p><p><strong>Efron first raised awareness to the possibility of the two of them going for a "date" when he asked Daddario for a "doggie date?" shortly after he uploaded a photo of his newly adopted dog, MACA.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daddario later posted a photo of her and her dog, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Efron commented</a>&nbsp;on as well.&nbsp; Remember when Efron said he likes making cheesy jokes when he's flirting? Efron also posted a shoutout to her on her birthday with this photo of the two of them along with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a>,</p><p>"Happy birthday to one of the the most real, down to 🌎, stunning, intelligent, creative, loving, and most rare Pokémon ever created."</p><p>Which is a message that regardless of if they're dating or not, we're sure Daddario really appreciated.</p><h2 id=no---the-potential-ramifications-of-a-break-up><strong>No - The Potential Ramifications of a Break-Up</strong></h2><p>The world is currently suffering the shock of yet another Hollywood power couple splitting up with Channing and Jenna Tatum electing to go their separate ways. They're not the first, and they definitely won't be the last couple in Hollywood that is going to struggle to stand the test of time. Hell, they probably won't be the last couple to break up this month.</p><p><strong>In fact, we're sure many power couples that haven't gotten together yet are still bound for a short-term fling in the sun.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If people are hesitant for Efron and Daddario to start engaging in a relationship, it may be out of concern as to what the ramifications could be if they break up. Especially if it doesn't end cleanly such as one of them cheating on the other.</p><h2 id=yes---they-d-keep-each-other-looking-amazing><strong>Yes - They'd Keep Each Other Looking Amazing</strong></h2><p>There is no question that the right partner can absolutely bring out the best in you and motivate you to want to improve your life. This includes perhaps influencing your decision to workout and eat right. Looking at Efron and Daddario's bodies and it becomes evident that they know what the inside of a weight room looks like.</p><p><strong>When talking about Zac's body for&nbsp;Baywatch, Daddario described it as being "insane".</strong></p><p>She also still works out with the trainer that helped get her into shape for the movie, so you know she is still packing some guns.
